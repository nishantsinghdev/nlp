What are the interest rates for a home loan foreclosure?
A$A$A
Based on the type of the interest rate charged on the home loan applied for, an applicant may or may not have to pay charges for foreclosure as well as prepayment of the loan.

As per a Reserve Bank of India directive, banks as well as Non-Banking Financial Companies cannot levy any penalty for foreclosure and prepayment of home loans with a floating rate of interest for individual borrowers.

However, for an individual who is applying for a Home Loan at a fixed interest rate, foreclosure charges will be levied by the lender. These charges will vary based on the lender- generally, it includes foreclosure charges that can range between 1% to 5% along with applicable taxes (service tax).

Home loans with floating as well as fixed rates of interest for non-individuals are also chargeable on foreclosure. Lenders charge service taxes and foreclosure penalty of around 1% to 5% for such cases.
A$A$A
I think you want know the foreclosures charges.

It's depends on bank to bank but generally floating rate loans doesn't charge any foreclosures charges.

For fixed rate of interest bank can charge 2% to 5% plus service tax on your outstanding principal amount.

Also some banks have lock in period for charges, before certain period if you close the loan they will levied foreclosures charges.

Q$Q$Q
What should I keep in mind before taking step towards home loan foreclosure?
A$A$A
If you are thinking about closing your Home Loan before the repayment tenure ends, you should consider the following things:

Type of Home Loan- If your loan has a fixed rate of interest, i.e., your interest is more or less unchanging, then you need to factor in the foreclosure charges before taking any step. For that, you can use an online Home Loan foreclosure calculator which you can find on your creditor’s website. If yours is a floating rate Home Loan, i.e., your rate of interest is revised from time to time by your lending institution, then you need not worry about the charges as they are not applicable for your case. Foreclosure charges are generally of the range of 3-4% for fixed rate Home Loans.

Finances- If you have the funds to foreclose your Home Loan, then you can definitely move ahead with your decision. If you feel that it can affect your lifestyle and your savings might take a hit, then it could be better to think again.

Time- Foreclosure can help you save a lot on the interest of your Home Loan if timed right- consider this option in the initial stages of repayment as then you are mostly paying the interest.

Tax Savings- Section 24B and Section 80C of the IT Act provide tax deductions on Home Loan repayment. Tally how much you would save on the interest with a foreclosure against the combined benefits of these two tax saving schemes. If you save more with the taxes, and less of the interest, then foreclosing might not be the best idea.

I would have to agree with Moe…Hi Moe.. I have been a client for years.

My specialty has been working with distressed homeowners. There are several sources. ML- implode was great.. Forclosure Hamlet, Livinglies. You can also set a google search for your foreclosure criteria as well.

Caution: Some sites that promote litigation and using securitization audits are often trolled by the more inept or unscrupulous types that try to lure distressed homeowners with promises that are too good to be true.

Do your homework, get referrals, and if someone promises to get you a “free house” through a magical technique ask for “proof of success”. If they can’t provide it, or won’t because the “settlement is sealed”, or some other nonsense….R-U-N.

Q$Q$Q
In a mortgage foreclosure action wherein the note-holder (lender) cannot locate the original loan documents (and/or is caught out attempting to forge them), who gets the collateral real estate, and what happens to the debt obligation?
A$A$A
As others have indicated, in many states is a requirement of the lender to product various documents (including the original note) before foreclosure proceedings can even begin in court. Because many states are changing their foreclosure laws, homeowners do have a few additional protections including the fact that the note must be produced as well as any additional documentation that indicates agreements or amendments associated with mortgage.

Some answers indicate that lenders have such good attorneys that they can drag out the proceedings for a considerable amount of time. However, depending on your state, there may be legislation that protects you against lenders doing this. There may be a specific timeframe that must be followed in order for the foreclosure to continue through court at all.

To answer your question, if you live in a state with these protections then the foreclosure cannot carry on and the mortgage will remain with the homeowner.

LawTrades offers comprehensive and affordable legal assistance, including real estate law. We would be happy to discuss your circumstances and help connect you with the right attorney. Foreclosures can certainly be difficult, but homeowners deserve to know their rights throughout the proceedings. Hope this helps.
A$A$A
One of the prerequisites for a foreclosure action is that the foreclosing party must be able to produce evidence sufficient to establish themselves as the note holder.  If the original note or a reasonably acceptable facsimile thereof cannot be produced, then the foreclosing party cannot establish their right to foreclose.  That doesn't have any effect on title, but under the same logic, the resident of the house can then sue to "quiet title", and again if no enforceable note can be located and presented, the title should revert to the mortgagee.

Of course, that's just the theoretical legal workings - in reality banks have expensive lawyers who can draw out the proceedings as long as they need to in order to leverage the mortgagee into compliance.
A$A$A
This answer is not a substitute for professional legal advice....
A$A$A
This is a very interesting question. In theory, the problem is not really with the holder of a mortgage note, or where the original loan documents are and whether they were properly transferred from one lender (or so-called "mortgage servicer") to the next. The problem is really with the recording of the mortgage note at the municipal offices where such documents are required to be memorialized in public records.

The final and most critical step in the mortgage process is the recording of the mortgage in the appropriate municipal office having jurisdiction over the property. This step 'announces' to the public, and puts any and all interested parties on notice, that a party has a lien or security interest in a property. Without this important action, many would argue that a transfer of ownership of the holder of a mortgage note cannot be legally valid. This is what actually consummates the transaction, even though a mortgage note itself can be legally valid if it has not been recorded.

This, I believe, is the crux of the problem.

By the early 1980s, mortgages and refinances became so numerous that the physical recording of mortgage documents in local municipal offices became burdensome on the banking industry. At that time, a private company called MERS emerged and eventually developed an innovative solution to what had become a drag on the industry. Essentially, MERS created a private electronic database through which lenders could make the necessary 'announcements' without having to physically record them and, since all lenders subscribed, it essentially became the agent of every lender and the holder of every mortgage transferred within its system.    

There is now much debate as to whether this system, which bypasses the physical recording of mortgage notes, has diluted the process to the point that actual ownership of the original note is difficult to determine at best, and impossible at worst. In the strictest of terms, no lender should ever have the right to initiate a foreclosure action without having physically filed a proper lien in the appropriate municipal office where the property is located.

The question of what happens when there is uncertainty over who holds an original note is an interesting one, since I would argue that the owner of record is simply the party who has properly recorded a mortgage interest that is still outstanding, without having recorded a "satisfaction of mortgage" document to extinguish it.
A$A$A
First, let's separate non-judicial foreclosure states, from judicial. In most non-judicial states there is no requirement to produce evidence that the foreclosing party holds the note (Nevada (state) recently changed their laws to add this requirement). Instead the right to foreclose is granted by the homeowner in the "deed of trust" to a trustee. The trustee can be changed through the recording of a substitution of trustee.

Bruce Feldman: note that MERS does not eliminate the recording of mortgages or deeds of trust; MERS is only used to keep track of "assignments", which document changes to the "beneficiary". Note that the term "beneficiary" itself has become convoluted. These days it typically reflects the "servicer" of the note (the party you send payments to), which may be different than the "holder" of the note (the actual lender).

Seems to me the crux of the problem is that state laws haven't kept up with changes in the lending industry. Specifically, I think the laws should be revised such that requirements for "servicers" vs. the acutal underlying "lender" are clearly spelled out.

As to the original question, if the lender can't locate the original note, then they can file a lost note affidavit. The borrower could certainly challenge such a filing, but for the borrower to prove it never existed they'd need a plausible explanation for why a mortgage or deed of trust was recorded, and where they came up with the money for the purchase, if not from said loan. Now one could argue that it was a different lender - but that issue would be between the lenders, and shouldn't give the borrower any relief from their obligation to repay the loan.
A$A$A
This is a great question, and although most have the law correct, all except one give the wrong final answer.

The owner of the house can discharge the mortgage and keep the collateral in their name! The alleged note holder loses the money because they did not secure their right to collect the security covering it.

It's a two step process. First to have the foreclosure dismissed, and second, the lien the mortgage places can be removed in either a quiet title action, or based on a specifically enumerated similar action.

First, you must defend the mortgage foreclosure. If you do not, the bank is legally allowed to foreclose without producing the original note. It's a combination of waiving certain rights, and the bank alleging in conclusion form that they are the rightful holder of the note. I did not write holder of original note- they will allege that they are the lawful owner of the debt.

The note is the promise to pay, the mortgage allows the property to be used as collateral. As stated, the MERS system was set up to keep track of mortgages so they did not have to be recorded with the local county clerks each time the loan was transferred. At such time as an entity did not get paid and needed the mortgage to commence a foreclosure, MERS would assign the mortgage to that entity, who would record it and commence an action.

The problem is, despite decades of use and hundreds of millions of dollars in securities collateralized this way, the banks learned that you cannot give one party the right to collect a note, and then another the right to foreclose. Only the entity with the right to receive payment can foreclose. In fact, in New York, it has been held that the mortgage ‘follows’ the note. So it is irrelevant who has the mortgage- it is worthless, and a fictitious right to foreclose is given to the entity holding the note.

An entity must be the assignee of the note, or the holder of a note endorsed in blank or “to the order of” and then blank. But you don't get to see the note unless you defend the foreclosure and specifically demand to see it.

There was an appellate division cases around 2 years ago that said while it would be better practiceto allege the circumstance upon receiving the note and mortgage, if the homeowners ails to defend the action, the bank only needs to allege in conclusion form that they indeed own it. It's a combination of the courts looking the other way when no one cares and a policy to make property useful when the house is vacant or dilapidated.

Once the foreclosure is dismissed, you can commence an action after the statute of limitations has run under rappel sec. 1501.

Here's the deal. You don't get a free house.You owe that money to somebody.

I know what you are thinking of. But that really hasn't been the case. I am not aware of forgeries by lenders.

What did happen was that bank officers swore under penalty of perjury that they had reviewed a borrower's entire loan record before signing an affidavit that the loan was in default. The reality was that some of them had not read all the records before signing paperwork to start the foreclosure.

But factually, the loans really were delinquent. In effect, they signed what was put in front of them withour reading it. But the underlying facts of loan delinquency and the right to foreclose were actually true facts.

In cases where the lender can't produce the original note, the courts will allow them to produce a bona fide substitue for the original. If they are caught forging evidence, the consequences can be severe, including criminal penalties for the parties involved in doing it. But it still doesn't get you a free house.

I'll explain why. The law recognizes that stuff happens. The law allows the existance of a fact, such as the existance of a debt, to be proven with reliable substitute evidence when the original has been accidentally lost or destroyed. Do you personally keep everything? Probably not, unless you are a hoarder. Even if you try to keep important papers, they could be accidentally lost or destroyed.

Suppose the bank building where original loan documents are stored got burned down. Should that mean that every borrower whose loan documents got destroyed will now get a free house?

Suppose you get in a car accident, and you are unable to find your insurance policy. Are you saying that the insurance company can deny your claim because you lost your paperwork?
A$A$A
I agree with a lot of the answers here given below. This is a very interesting question.  Under New York law, in order for the bank to foreclose on real property it must establish standing.  The Bank of New York v. Silverberg case made it clear that the bank must have physical possession of the note in order to establish its prima facie case.  The bank can meet this burden by providing an affidavit from an authorized individual who has the knowledge to affirm when the bank obtained possession of the note.  Under the recent decision Aurora Loan Services v. Taylor, the affidavit must provide the exact date of possession.  As one can imagine, this is a tough burden to meet.  The affidavit must be meet the business record exception which can be challenging.  From my experience, majority of the affidavits do not meet the business record exception and are deemed hearsay as the affidavit fail to lay a proper foundation for the business record to be admitted. 

In most instances, these issues do not come up in Court unless the borrower retains an attorney who can properly raise these issues.

Best of luck

What happens is that on the rare occasion that an already struggling homeowner is able to finance a legal defense formidable enough to go up against the banks bottomless pit of overpaid legal henchmen, and the bank is caught with the smoking pen. They quickly take it to settlement talks. The owner retains the collateral. It rarely goes to trial when the bank sees their paper is bad.

In New Mexico, where I practice, the matter of notes (negotiable instruments) is governed by section 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Section 3-306 (NMSA sec. 55-3-30) deals with the issue of a lost note.  Here is actual statute,  it is probably the same in every state that has adopted the UCC. 

(a)   A person not in possession of an instrument is entitled to enforce the instrument if (i) the person was in possession of the instrument and entitled to enforce it when loss of possession occurred, (ii) the loss of possession was not the result of a transfer by the person or a lawful seizure, and (iii) the person cannot reasonably obtain possession of the instrument because the instrument was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot be determined, or it is in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or a person that cannot be found or is not amenable to service of process.  

(b)   A person seeking enforcement of an instrument under Subsection (a) must prove the terms of the instrument and the person's right to enforce the instrument.  If that proof is made, Section 55-3-308 NMSA 1978 applies to the case as if the person seeking enforcement had produced the instrument.  The court may not enter judgment in favor of the person seeking enforcement unless it finds that the person required to pay the instrument is adequately protected against loss that might occur by reason of a claim by another person to enforce the instrument. Adequate protection may be provided by any reasonable means.

Servicer? lender? investor? The great majority of mortgages today are investor owned with the great majority of them owned by either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. The servicer is the entity that a borrower receives notices from and makes payments to. For example Bank of America is a servicer of loans for over 500 investors. They also own their own loans.

While Robo Signing and sloppy paperwork by lenders and servicers has received a lot of press, the facts remain that the great majority of loans in question are in fact in default and payments have not been made.

Those loans that are in default and do not have a clear chain of title or had a foreclosure improperly initiated has slowed foreclosures and backed up the pipeline. But once rectified those loans in default will be foreclosed upon properly.

How do I do a foreclosure for a HDFC car loan?
A$A$A
I would suggest you not to foreclose any loan if taken in your life since , generally as per the redusing intrest type of structure of bank , they actually get their 60% of the total intrest in their half tenure also if you are at too early stage of your loans emi payment and have paid only a smaller amount of your intrest , private bank charges a special foreclose penalty as specific % of your pricipal amount added to close the loan .

So it doesn't makes any of sense to do so .

That's why i would suggest to to work though your calculation that weather foreclosing your loan makes any sense or not .
A$A$A
You will have to visit any of their asset servicing branch ( every city has one or more) . Ask for outstanding amount which may or may not include preclosure penalty. Submit the amount and loan will be closed.
A$A$A
By foreclosure you mean prepayment.. right?

If yes, then get in touch with your branch.. you will have to pay some (pre-payment) fee for the the loan prepayment & closure
A$A$A
you can close by visiting retail asset centre and thy eill provide u foreclosure statement ..deposit tht much amount n you will be free ..noc will be generated instantly in cases otjerwise they eill send to your registred address

Q$Q$Q
Does the foreclosure of a loan increase your credit score?
A$A$A
Foreclosure means the act of taking possession of the mortgaged property when the mortgagor fails to keep up their mortgage payments. This basically reflects that the individual failed to repay their loan, and this will have the same effect on the credit score as a loan default would. Foreclosure would decrease your credit score.

However, it could be possible that you are confusing foreclosure with preclosure, which is when you pay your loan back before the stipulated period of time. Preclosure will surely increase your credit score, and it will have a positive impact on your credit history.
A$A$A
Yes, IT will have a negative impact on credit score because customer was not able to repay the loan amount so banks foreclosure the loan. Banks has also certain factors where they need to show up their reputation in front of RBI, SO lower the NPA( Non- performing account) If the banks has more the number of NPA then RBI will think that this banks more defaulters so they in further not allow the bank other benefits that will get from RBI.

Q$Q$Q
What is the typical/historical percentage loan principal loss in home mortgage foreclosure?
A$A$A
This is a great monthly publication. Start at page 42, then read until page 51:

https://www.tcw.com/News_and_Com...

Check out this chart for historicals. Severity is basically % loss.
A$A$A
It varies by state. Here are the numbers for the 5 states where we have coverage:



Keep in mind that this is principal loss on a foreclosed mortgage loan, based on the bid at sale. If the property becomes REO at the sale, then the loan may be subject to further losses. We calculated the loss from the loan balance, not from market value of the home at the time of the sale. This is only the loss on the foreclosed loan, and not from the total loan balance if there was more than one loan. For example if the first mortgage foreclosed, say for a 20% loss, there might have also been a second, subordinate mortgage that suffered a 100% loss and that "second" would not be included here.
A$A$A
This question is fraught with problems. For example, what exactly constitutes a loss of principal? Is the typical/historical loss period just for the recent housing crisis or since the inception of consumer mortgage loans?

Another major problem is that a Foreclosures is merely the seizure and sale of a mortgage loan's collateral; it is not a satisfaction, forebearance or forgiveness of the debt (which includes principal presumably lost). The mortgage note remains after foreclosure unless the loan is discharged by agreement, bankruptcy or other action (or if the foreclosed property was sufficient to pay off the debt).

Yet another problem is the recent 1997-2006 United States Housing Bubble, in which most homes were severely overvalued when the mortgage loan was made. Thus, a loss of principal is by some measure a loss of "value" that never existed in the first place.

Say a stock is valued by its fundamentals at $50, and I buy it at an inflated value of $100. When it comes back to $50 and I sell it, I've lost $50. But suppose I financed that purchase by getting a bank to lend me $80 and I put in $20? When the stock is sold at $50, how much of my $20 will I lose and how much of the bank's $80 will be lost?

Prior to the recent housing crisis, foreclosure losses of principal throughout the industry were extremely low, so a "historical" analysis of foreclosures would not be particularly meaningful in that context.
