What is loan modification?
A$A$A
While applying for a modification of the home loan, one has to make out the positives and negatives.There are homeowners not in a position to make their mortgage payments on time. These are the people who can have an advantage from acquiring a loan modification.There are varieties of methods via which loan modification can be done. But, all the methods possess the same goal in mind.

There is the option of retaining the homeowners in their homes by making modifications to the mortgage terms and conditions. Also, modifications could be done to the payment. This makes it affordable to the borrowers.

There is an advantage from the home loan modification not only for homeowners but also for lenders. It is a method that works in favor of lenders to avoid undergoing the foreclosure process. This is applicable when the borrower is undergoing difficulty and will find it difficult to make payments on time.

The process of home loan modification is a feasible solution to assist the homeowners such that they avoid the foreclosure. Also, affordable mortgage payment comes to the assistance of the homeowners.

For one to deserve the home loan modification, he or she has to stick to the qualifications and conditions imposed by the lender. Some homeowners may be in dark about the process of home loan modification. They may not know what the positive and negative outcomes are. But, there are many positive outcomes in the home loan modification. The process of home loan modification has been in the debate for the last couple of years.

Positive outcomes of the Home Loan Modification:

So as to cut off the monthly payment with regard to a mortgage without making modifications to the interest or the principal amount, one can extend the term that the loan involves. Also, savings option would come to the aid of borrowers. But, the payments take a longer time to be fulfilled. It is a viable option by providing different options to avoid foreclosure. This is considerable when the borrower contemplates shifting residence at some point of time.

At particular junctures, the lenders concede cutting off the interest rates. But, this is done over a short span of time. The short term cut-off can assist the homeowner during times of financial burden. There is the option of refinancing of the loan for interest cut-off permanently.

A mortgage modification is an agreement between the lender ( the holder of the mortgage ) and the borrower ( homeowner ) to alter & change the terms of the original loan arrangement entered into between them. This process is usually initiated by the borrower in an attempt to lower the monthly mortgage payments due the lender.

 Recent economic problems together with falling home values plus the many toxic loan products currently being held by many homeowners has led the government to pressure banks to respond to the demand on the part of borrowers to provide relief from burdensome home loans.

 The mortgage modification process is based upon a formula that takes into account the debt to income ratio of the borrower among other factors and can take months to complete. It can be undertaken by the homeowner but should be handled by a professional, usually an attorney experienced in this area.

Wikipedia says "Mortgage modification is a process where the terms of a mortgage are modified outside the original terms of the contract agreed to by the lender and borrower (i.e mortgagor and mortgagee). In general, any loan can be modified."

So loan modification is just a more generic term if the loan does not cover the purchase of a dwelling.  The government and banks are setting up programs where the banks will make all efforts to help families keep their house if they can set up a plan for them to pay.  Too many people are just walking away from their loans because what they owe is more than what the property is worth.  But just walking away will destroy their credit for seven years and they will still have to pay rent during that seven year period at least afdter which time the housing market may have recovered and all the bargains may be gone.  So the banks may be willing to settle for less money than they are really owed to avoid taking a loss when they foreclose and have to sell the house in a depressed market.

A Loan Modification is a permanent change in one or more of the terms of a Borrower’s loan. Often times, the payment amount is lowered to a payment the Borrower can afford by extending the loan, lowering the interest rate, and possibly a principal reduction. The Borrower may only receive one Loan Modification within a twenty four month period.

A modification to an existing loan made by a lender in response to a borrower's long-term inability to repay the loan. Loan modifications typically involve a reduction in the interest rate on the loan, an extension of the length of the term of the loan, a different type of loan or any combination of the three.

A loan modification agreement is different from a forbearance agreement. A forbearance agreement provides short-term relief for borrowers who have temporary financial problems, while a loan modification agreement is a long-term solution for borrowers who will never be able to repay an existing loan.

Loan modification is a kind of process where a borrower's mortgage  is modified. In this case both the lender and the borrower are bound by the new terms and conditions of the loan agreement. The three important points considered in loan modifications are-

1. Lowering the interest rates.

2. Forgiveness of default payment.

3. Reducing the loan balance.

Q$Q$Q
Are federal loan modification programs like HAMP intended to succeed?
A$A$A
In my opinion, to substantially "succeed" in slowing the rate of foreclosures would have required a vast sum of money to be given out in a fairly indiscriminate manner to delinquent borrowers.  The vast sum of money method would never fly especially in the anti-deficit political environment and because such an approach would invite widespread fraud. Short of throwing piles of money at the problem though, the system is simply too rigid, whether it is the private servicing industry, the securitization and secondary market or the legal foreclosure mechanisms.  Also, when such a program is instituted there have to be checks in place so that the aid only goes to those that truly need it.  This means the system requires a bureaucracy which, in turn, damages the speed and efficiency of the process.  In the face of these difficulties, HAMP did manage to secure some number of permanent modifications.  So when judging whether or not it was designed to succeed, it is important to keep in mind what is a success. If purely judging on how many people received permanent modifications, then it was a failure and the design was a flop.  If you consider that assistance should only go to those who could prove real hardship or that had a real chance to stay current after a permanent modification or that taxpayer funds should be guarded from fraud, then the design and results look somewhat better. 

But in some way, this is like trying to cool a broken nuclear reactor.  Once the system has reached a breakdown of a certain level, there is no good way to quickly and easily settle things down.
A$A$A
The program succeeded: the bottom of the 1997-2006 United States Housing Bubble and subsequent crash was (probably) not as bad as it could have been, absent the Home Affordable Refinance Program.

It prevented a lot of homes from being foreclosed on and coming into the real estate market during a time when there was already oversupply, which was depressing prices (home values). Even more homes on the market would have meant even lower prices and even more homeowners “under water” (or “upside down”) in their mortgages, ergo, the Federal Government of the United States was trying to put a Price Floor under the residential real estate market.

It’s not surprising that it failed to keep even a majority of the homeowners in their homes - that would require the homeowners to find jobs with enough pay to make the payments. Some likely did, and they benefitted from the program. Others merely had their foreclosures delayed - they benefitted to the extent that they had extra time in a home that they could not afford. The banks that made mortgage loans on those homes also benefitted from lower loan losses in foreclosure from a somewhat less saturated real estate market.
A$A$A
They were supposed to. However, according to a 3rd QTR 2015 report to Congress…their is an 80% denial rate for borrowers who apply for HAMP and not even 2M Homeowners have received permanent modification under the program…a far cry from the 4–6 Million t was suppose to help.

Honestly…post 2009 there has never been an easier time for a Homeowner to save their home from foreclosure. However, as you can see with an 80% denial rate…if this is the easiest time…then it shows what it was like pre-2009.

The initial concept behind HAMP I believe was well meaning. According to statistics over 500,000 home loans have been modified. However, that is woefully short of the many millions of home owners the government originally intended to assist with this program. In my opinion the initiative cannot be considered a success. This is evidenced by the continuing attempt by the administration to prod banks to find ways to assist more distressed home owners.
A$A$A
This program has been under a lot of criticism because the projected amount of home owners it was suppose to help has fallen short.  It hasn't failed, the program has helped over 500,000 people stay in their homes.
A$A$A
with a less than 1 percent success rate it is hard to say that it is intended to have success. I believe the hamp program was brought about with good intentions but had a poor delivery of success because of investor guidelines and original psa agreements.
A$A$A
Yes, however, this program struggles due to the guidelines, how many previous bad loans where given, and the process of how the lenders are dealing with the requests for help.

Q$Q$Q
What is a good news source for mortgage loan modification, foreclosure, and real estate? Why?
A$A$A
I would have to agree with Moe…Hi Moe.. I have been a client for years.

My specialty has been working with distressed homeowners. There are several sources. ML- implode was great.. Forclosure Hamlet, Livinglies. You can also set a google search for your foreclosure criteria as well.

Caution: Some sites that promote litigation and using securitization audits are often trolled by the more inept or unscrupulous types that try to lure distressed homeowners with promises that are too good to be true.

Do your homework, get referrals, and if someone promises to get you a “free house” through a magical technique ask for “proof of success”. If they can’t provide it, or won’t because the “settlement is sealed”, or some other nonsense….R-U-N.

ps: I wrote a book in 2012 “ When Bad Mortgages Happen to Good Homeowners”

Q$Q$Q
What are the typical terms of a permanent loan modification?
A$A$A
Homeowners that are facing a change in their finances may not be able to uphold their original mortgage agreement. If you are falling behind or are at risk of missing a payment, a permanent modification is the smartest way to avoid losing the home to foreclosure.

Understanding Loan Modifications

Changing the terms of a mortgage loan is a way to permanently reduce the amount due each month. This type of permanent change is an agreement designed to give the borrower a more affordable plan that will prevent falling behind. The lender typically agrees to reduce the principal balance, reduce the rate of interest, extend the term length, or switch from a variable rate to fixed interest.

Common Violations in Loan Modifications

A homeowner may try to do the right thing and act quickly to get a modification in motion before the circumstances get out of control. Unfortunately, the modification process can get complicated if the mortgage servicer fails to handle any of the following aspects of the process properly.

Untimely Application Processing

Lengthy delays waiting on the official decision often occur if the servicer fails to notify the homeowner of missing documents. The reason for this is a failure on their part to review the request within a reasonable amount of time. As of January 2014, rules changed to ensure that the servicer has to review the application, determine if it is complete, and update the borrower within a reasonable time.

Claiming The Homeowner Must Be In Default

It is not necessarily true that a homeowner must have a late payment to get approved for a modification, but some mortgage servicers may state it as fact. According to the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), a homeowner can qualify when in danger of falling behind on their payment schedule.

Asking for Resubmitted Information

A homeowner may be asked more than once to submit new information, such as updated income verification paperwork. It may also be requested again if prior paperwork is lost by the servicer. It is necessary to resubmit the information, but keep a detailed record of the date, recipient, and any tracking information.

Requiring a Down Payment

A down payment is not required to receive a HAMP modification, and this is also true of most other modifications.

Processing the Application with Incorrect Income Information

The modification process is influenced by an evaluation of financial information, property information, and the original loan. A comparison is made between the cash flow to the investor if foreclosed and cash flow if the loan is modified. The servicer does not have to agree to a modification if there is more profit from a foreclosure.

Slipping a Waiver into the Documents

It is not allowed a servicer to ask a borrower to waive any of their rights in the process of applying for a modified loan. On occasion, they may try to put a waiver into the agreement stating an agreement to release legal claims against the lender or servicer.

Not Converting the Trial Modification into Permanent Status

Under some programs, a three month trial period is set into motion under the new terms. If payments are made on-time, then the modification should become permanent if all criteria is met. The servicer may fail to uphold their end of the agreement after a homeowner meets their obligations.

Servicing Transfers During the Modification

Anytime a servicing transfer occurs during a modification, the old servicer is responsible for sending the new servicer any agreements made with the borrower and information regarding current status discussions with the borrower. The new servicer has to honor any existing agreements made in the modification.

What are the typical terms of a permanent loan modification?
A$A$A
A good modification will typically be a long term solution such as a 30 year fix with an interest rate that is similar or at today's rate. Chase does offer the government HAMP program as well which offers a very affordable payment for most home owners. I would check with your bank today and call to see what long terms solutions they have available.

Q$Q$Q
What's the best way to get approved for a loan modification?
A$A$A
If your seeking a loan modification, this means that you are already in default or default is imminent. Here is what I suggest…

First, know what you are doing and before you contact your lender. You need to educate yourself on what programs you are eligible for before you start engaging with your Lender.

Second, make sure you get treated fairly, this goes with the first item of know what you are doing…there is a lot of Lender misconduct…the Lender / Loan Services not treating the Borrower fairly or evaluating their situation in compliance with regulatory requirements….you need to know

Third, again…know what you are doing…this time in the way that you prepare your hardship application and engineer your financial package. This is a lot like doing your taxes…if you prepare it right = good results, you prepare it wrong = bad results.

According to a congressional report published 3rd Qtr 2015 (not even a year ago) it says 8 in 10 Homeowners that apply for a loan modification are denied. So…with all of that said…if you’re going to do this on your own…you should take the time and educate yourself on the process and program parameters.

Improving your credit score, getting a good insight on your assets and liabilities as well as additional banking documents and financial statements are just some of the documents and aspects that you need to provide and improve to be able to get a loan modified. Asking a financial adviser can also help you attain a modification that is within your means. You can visit this website for more details.

Q$Q$Q
How do I become a loan modification officer?
A$A$A
I need more information. But if you mean someone who just does refinance loans, you’ll find that difficult, mostly because the interest rate market controls much of the refinance business.

When interest rates are increasing, there is little refinance (modification) business. When interest rates are falling, there are more opportunities but that does not last forever.

Better question is how do you become an expert at all types of mortgages and know when to advise a client when refinance is a better option than taking a home equity loan.
A$A$A
It depends on the lender you work for and your position in the company.

Is there something called a loan modification agreement?
A$A$A
Is there is. Ask your bank regarding the same.
E$E$E

Q$Q$Q
What is the formula used for approving someone for a loan modification?
A$A$A
There is not set formula in being approved for a loan modification. It all comes down to if you can truly afford the mortgage and have the ability to pay long term a decent interest rate to the lender. If you have a job or business with steady income and can pay your mortgage at a reduced rate no less than 2-3%, then you may be approved for a loan modification.
E$E$E

Q$Q$Q
Do you have to be behind of your mortgage to obtain a loan modification?
A$A$A
The only place you’re going to get the answer is by working directly with your loan servicer. None of us on Quora know what your Deed of Trust says, who holds your note, etc.

Look at it from the perspective of the person you’re paying back. If you loaned someone 100,000 and they called you and asked to modify the terms, what would you say? Heck no! “You signed a note/promise to repay and I want my money as we agreed in this contract.”

The only motivation for loan servicing to modify the contract is to avoid foreclosure. Why would they want to modify your note and deed of trust (or mortgage if you live in a mortgage state) if you are paying the loan back as agreed?

The job of loan servicing is to collect the principal and interest, taxes and insurance, and to divvy that money to the places it goes, according to the contracts signed. Depending on who holds the note, they might not have authority to modify the loan unless you’re facing foreclosure.

If you are getting the run-around from loan servicing, find a local, HUD-approved Housing Counseling Agency near your city (you can just google that^) and go talk with someone about your options. These agencies are typically free to people in financial distress.

Good luck!
A$A$A
A loan modification can happen any time you can get the lender (or whoever owns the mortgage note) to agree to the changes. Under normal circumstances, this can be very difficult.

If you are behind one or two mortgage payments, the lender might be more cooperative. I know of some people who skipped a couple of payments (even though they could afford them) in order to get a loan modification (this is not a recommended way of doing things).

Another possibility for a borrower whose outstanding balance is more than the market value of the property is a federal program called a HARP loan. A HARP loan generally means that the bank will reduce some of the principal of the note. Banks call this a “hair cut”. The federal government pays the lender for the amount of the haircut.

While a HARP loan sounds good on paper, there are secondary issues that can be very tricky.

We were approached by our bank to do a HARP loan. We almost went through with it but found some disturbing things that stopped us.

Under normal circumstances, when a lender gives a borrower a hair cut on the loan, the amount of the hair cut is considered income to the borrower (the bank just forgave some of the debt). For HARP loans, the hair cut is exempt from federal taxation. However, the states have different ways of handling the hair cut. In California, where we live, the hair cut was taxable income at the time (may be different now). So we would have had to pay taxes on the $80k hair cut we were about to get.

Secondly, from the bank’s perspective, the hair cut amounts to a charge off (or something similar). Our bank was going to report the hair cut to the credit reporting agencies. Having a charge off on your credit history does bad things to your credit score.

That made two good reasons for us to run for the exits.
A$A$A
No, you do not. During the early stages of modern mortgage loan modification, borrowers were advised, in some cases, to become delinquent to get a loan modification. I never understood the logic behind this, as some people were aware enough, to ask for help before their situation was really out of control. The most elementary logic would tell you to, still, modify the loan if the requesting party could prove they were really in dire straits although they were current. I cannot tell you the number of people that I've talked to who have a real challenge getting a refinance because they were told to be late, when all they needed was a little relief and could've stayed current. If you ask me, I think everybody, who can prove they were advised to be late, when they could've remained current, should have a special notation on their credit report. Just my opinion. I have included a link below which also explains this.

Should you skip your mortgage payment?
A$A$A
No. However you must establish and prove the need for a modification. The best place to start is with a HUD authorized housing counselor. This professional help is available for you at little to no cost.
