Why do many middle and lower middle class people in the US mortgage a house then put it up for rent (as an investment) but most wealthy people do not?
A$A$A
The “anyone can invest in real estate” mantra has been a constant fixture in the US. Regardless of the market going up or down, there is no shortage of real estate gurus telling people how to make a killing on property.

Buy foreclosed homes. Renovate and flip. Buy to let. You can find countless guides, websites, ebooks, etc. on these subjects. But I will let you in a secret.

The reason the authors of these systems are selling ebooks and guides is because they cannot make money investing in property.

Back to your question. Everyone likes the pitch which is something like this:

Hate your job? No money at the end of the month?

You can make a killing flipping property or be sitting on the beach while idiots pay you rent.

The wealthy don't have a job and have money at the end of the month. So the pitch only works on the middle class.

Now, look at how professional investors do property. Do you think they buy an apartment in their neighborhood, collect rent and do the property management? NO. That is not very profitable and it is not scalable.

If I want to get income from residential real estate I get into a deal. A while back I purchased with other people a multifamily development of 169 units. There is professional property management and the debt on the property was at a cheaper rate than I could get on a mortgage. I got a check every quarter and a report.

There are plenty of property deals on multifamily, hospitality, office, medical and industrial assets. These are listed, but usually too large for a middle class investor to do alone. Plus you really don't want to do alone. So network with people in your community. Doctors and athletes in particular get offered a lot of these deals.

Also, property management companies try to find investors so they can then earn fees from running the property. I'm looking at a deal now that was sent to me by a company that manages hotels. They have more than 200 hotels in the US and know what they are doing. But they are not in the business of owning hotels so they need investors. It works both ways.

As in any investment, do your homework and make sure you are investing with solid people and in a good opportunity.

Good luck!

I believe it is due to the fact that ordinary houses as an asset class are on the upper spectrum of affordability for lower and middle income people. For instance an individual in a lower to middle income range would have to stretch to afford the mortgage payments on a single family house - said payment may fall between $1000 to $2000 per month which is a large portion of their monthly income. The net monthly income generated by the house once it is rented out and all expenses are deducted will likely only be a few hundred dollars per month, maybe $200 to $500 +/- on a home that is worth $150k to $350k. This net income is in no way worth a wealthy person’s time and consideration or hassle for that matter.

In addition to the relatively low net monthly income, it is well known by wealthy individuals that the vast preponderance of legal recourse is in favor of the residential tenant. For instance, a residential property must be “habitable” or else the landlord is responsible. The landlord of a residential dwelling is obligated to repair air conditioning, heating, plumbing and similar matters immediately. Compare this to commercial real estate where commercial tenants are responsible for the unit build out, the maintenance of air conditioning and plumbing systems etc. The wealthy person will naturally be drawn to commercial real estate because the time burden on him or her is much less.

Also, commercial real estate is ordinarily more expensive and rent terms are longer - 3, 5 and 10 year terms are common which smooths out the earning cycle for the wealthy investor. He or she can count on not having to re-advertise to rent the dwelling every 6 months or every year. Finally, it is normally the case that commercial units are rented to businesses that have more money and are less likely to not pay. There are payment issues even with businesses to be sure, but not as much as with low to mid income renters who are living paycheck to paycheck and who may have a life emergency and then suddenly be unable to make their rent payment that month.

I personally know a landlord who owns and rents nearly 40 individual townhouses in minneapolis and he told me that there has not once ever been a single month without some tenant having to be evicted, or bouncing a check or skipping a rent payment. He literally has a full time job collecting rent, writing eviction notices, repairing toilets and filling out section 8 forms. Sadly, he actually makes more money on late payment fees than on the differential between cost and base rent. Commercial real estate, all things being equal (interest rates, property values, etc) is much more compatible with a wealthy person’s portfolio.

The premise of your question is faulty. It is not true that only middle and lower middle class people use this investment opportunity. I suspect the issue lies in how you define “middle class” The median household income in the US is about $55K. These people are middle class. It would be reasonable to include household incomes up to about $85K or so in the middle class because they are still below the top 25% of earners.

As a matter of fact many middle and lower middle class people can not get approved for mortgages and do not have the savings to pay the down payment (typically 25% to 30% on an investment property). Middle class people that believe in real estate, especially in the first half of their working lives are typically using their excess cash flow to buy a house for themselves to live in. Middle class people typically don’t have the cash to come up with a down payment on a 2nd property until middle age. Lower middle class people never get there.

Rental real estate is a reasonably common investment for those that are not comfortable with putting all their money in the stock market and are comfortable with investing some of their time managing the property.

The income range for the typical real estate investor is probably about $75K to $200K per year. This income range encompasses some of the middle class and much of the upper class. A $200K income is higher than about 95% of the households in the US.

I also disagree with your suggestion that residential real estate is a bad investment. Of course it can be a bad investment if you pay too much, but it also can be a very good investment if you get a good deal. You must analyze the cash flows. It isn’t uncommon to experience a reasonably stable annual return over 20% per year.

They do it because they do not understand risk management and real premises behind their decisions. The rationale goes something like ‘X never goes down’ so they leverage themselves with mortgages and think they made a safe investment decision as they are risk-averse.

Such situations are actually loaded with risk, as their investments are highly leveraged, where the leverage ratio (price of house/equity) is 10–20X or more. It is funny when one talks with a supposedly risk-averse person about a margin account at a brokerage leveraged 2X and they consider it high-risk and then think nothing of leveraging themselves 20X with a 5% down payment.

Sophisticated investors know that there are no investments that ’always go up’ and that it is all about timing inevitable cycles. Less sophisticated ones refuse to admit and acknowledge obvious facts such as investment cycles and instead engage in simple rationalizations, e.g. prices in Florida will be always high because of proximity to beaches and influx of foreign money etc. Such simplistic thinking is further popularized and reinforced by endless house-flipping shows on TV.

Investments cycles are in essence driven by interest rates. There is no mystery why house prices are high again, for the second time during the last 10 years. The chief reason is eight years of zero-interest rate policies (ZIRP), and even negative rates (NIRP), pursued by central banks world-wide. Nothing has been learned from the previous crashes and the cycle is repeating itself, as it always does.

There are probably several factors that lead folks to do this. To start with, this is an investment that is both familiar and at least conceptually easy to understand: You buy a home and let someone make payments on it. Ultimately, any mortgage is retired, and hopefully, home prices appreciate and a sizable asset will remain and can be leveraged or liquefied as desired.

It also bears consideration that residential real estate is one of the very, very few places that "Joe Sixpack" is actually allowed to use leverage to increase his purchasing power, which can have a magnifying effect on the increase in value available as an investment. A mortgage for an investment property might require a 20 or 25% downpayment, but an a mortgage for an owner-occupied homes can be purchased in some cases with as little as 3 percent down (occasionally less). That said, the borrower must legally reside in the property for a reasonable period of time before they move to a new home and rent out the old, but this isn't all that uncommon. Please know that taking out an owner-occupied residential mortgage where there is a clear intent at the outset to rent the property is known as "occupancy fraud," and can be prosecuted as a felony.

Depending upon market conditions, this leverage can produce considerable returns. In recent years, even savings deposits locked up for longish period (3-5 years) have returned very little, so an investable sum of say $50,000 might have been returning 1-1.5 percent at best. Contrast this against residential real estate; nationally, home prices have been humming along at perhaps 6% per year for the last 3-4 years, so a $50,000 investment that leveraged a $200,000 home purchase 4 years ago might have seen the value rise to perhaps $238,000 over that time -- so that $50,000 investment is now worth a gross $88,000 invested in a house, rather than perhaps $52,200 plunked in a CD over that time.

There's also probably a bit of "me-tooism" happening in some areas, (probably called Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) now). We saw this sort of behavior happening back during the "boom" years of the last decade, when it seemed like everyone and his brother was making money in real estate, whether buying and flipping, or improving and selling or simply accumulating as many properties as possible with little or no skin in the game. Today's environment isn't quite the same, but there certainly are elements of it that are evident.

All in all, why do people do this? It seems attractive, easy (or at least understandable) and a way to make outsized returns compared to other investments. From this view, the negatives seem few, and risks of losing money appear manageable. What could go wrong?
A$A$A
In my experience, wealthy people will wait out market cycles in order to buy at a specific cap rate. The cap rate being the expected rate of return on their money. An example of this would be spending $250k on a investment that creates post expense profit (excluding income tax) of $25k would yield a 10% capitalization (cap) rate. True real estate investors largely don't care much about appreciation and often hold investment property for very long periods of time or until the housing markets becomes so irrationally overheated that they can justify the cost of capital gains taxes and recuperation of the depreciation deductions that occur when an investment property is sold. In other words, professional real estate investors are looking for a return on deployed capital and are usually not speculating on an increase in property values.

As for the leveraged folks, they are counting the spread between the debt service and the rents ( the cash on cash return). This works best for large commercial investments but can be dangerous for the smaller, highly leveraged single family home buyers. The reason being is that a large repair bill or a long period of vacancy will erase any gains on the spread because the mortgage payment doesn't go away. Most leveraged buyers of single properties as an investment are really not considered investors, rather speculators who are hoping the rents cover the cost of ownership and banking on appreciation to make their profits. Sadly, this is terrible long term plan because when values decrease (and they always do eventually), the leveraged folks are stuck with a unsellable property and are 1 major repair away from insolvency and/or foreclosure.

Borrowing money to invest in something is almost always a bad idea. You wouldn’t borrow $200K and go to the horse races to gamble it, would you? As many of the other responders said - all that it takes is for a few months of bad checks, tenants who won’t vacate the property, and when they finally do, they trash the place and you’ll be bankrupt.

My advice is still “Buy the worst house that you can stand living in, in the best neighborhood that you can afford”. Before you buy it though, research it thoroughly and be sure that it’s very low priced for a house in that neighborhood and make sure that the neighborhood is stable and growing. Move in, renovate it (or renovate it & move in), live in it until you find another great deal and start over. You won’t have to pay Capital Gains Tax, you won’t have to put up with bad tenants trashing your place and writing you bad checks, and you won’t get calls at 2 AM because they have a stopped up toilet and the heating system quit working…

Many, if not all wealthy people are wealthy from what they know about. they may have one or two areas they are comfortable investing in because its what they know. If they do not have real estate experience they will usually not venture into that market

Several years ago, after many years with various start-ups that I became involved with and other things I tried I realized I never developed a solid retirement plan. I decided I was going to buy a home, live in it for a couple years then buy another, move and rent the first one out and repeat every few years providing I could mortgage them all which I was fairly certain I could with a FICA over 800.

The idea was that I would get up to ten of these properties and let others pay the mortgage, interest, etc. and have a little extra from each for anything that might be needed. After 20–30 years with very little if anything left on the mortgage and increase in property value I’d have maybe a couple million available. I’d sell one at a time and live off the money which would also be mostly invested short term.

That was my basic foundation for the plan but realized that as more experience in anything creates more contact and more opportunities that will pop up for investing. I am still working on it but due to a couple set backs from health issues I no longer have an over 800 FICA . But that should be hard to get back quickly.

That was an idea to get caught up in what I should have started long ago quickly. letting someone else put the money into your mortgage over 20 years means it is just accumulating wealth for you and as long as you do not need to make additional investments in maintenance or repairs on those properties. the oldest was built in 2005.

If you try investing in real estate look at foreclosures, tax liens and/or find a realtor that will help you make offers on several properties well under listing price. most will be a no or hell no but then one will be accepted. Sometimes a family will inherit something and have their own wealth and home, live far away and just want to sell it and not deal with it. This happens every now and then. No sad stories to listen to or evictions to process, etc. But may require more money to update it to rent or may just be a better flip house than long term.

The other answer I read who mentioned home flipping doing better for those who have been doing for awhile in offering education or a simple book but those aren’t doing so good either unless the author(s) are or were part on a show on the subject.

People haven’t been confident in investing or they haven’t had the ability to take any risks the past 9 years but things are starting to show signs this is changing. consumer confidence higher than its been since about 2006 or 2007. Sometimes just a president talking up the future can have an effect. but opportunities need to be there moving forward. Government just needs to get the hell out of the way and let the people build this countries future. Politicians always screw things up.
A$A$A
Simple economics and opportunity. Middle and Lower class can’t just buy a 2nd property as you need 20–30% down on a “investment” property. That means if you want to buy a $250K home for a rental property, you need at least $50K to put down. Not a lot of families with household income of $200K > x are going to clear that much capital. So the easiest way to avoid that 20% down is to jump into a new home and keep your existing property as a rental property.

If you’re wealthy, or let’s just use my friends - friends who make over $1M per year. They have different things they can get into that pay back faster and more than housing properties. They can get into storage units that can get them incomes of up to $400K per year. They can also get into other commercial deals that are paying them back quickly instead of the slow accrue of residential real estate deals.

So in the end, the ‘rich’ friends I have can do both - they can put down $1M or moref or a larger investment opportunity or get a bigger loan/credit for an investment while my other friends are relegated to buy a new house, lease the old property scenario.

Because….

Mortgages are easy to get in the US. You can borrow on 5:1 margin or more to buy real estate vs, virtually nothing for other assets.

A naive analysis of the profit and loss would lead one to believe you're making money if the gross rent exceeds the interest payments.

If you get it wrong and otherwise have little assets, the bankruptcy rules basically give you a free option. Heads, you make money in real estate. Tails, you file BK.

The whole USA debt markets and money printing is results of such as cause and so is its effects. Treasury gets billion printed by Federal bank and put such cash of billions in the banking systems in USA banks.

Now banks have billions which it should put to fund industry and businesses but smart business house or industry does not absorb debt as it can go to equity option and raise debts.

So bank targets the middle and lower middle class who has no such need for mortgages but great selling happens.

They are told two lies,

A. Interest payments is as percentage much lower than the interest for rents

B. Price of house will double every five years.

When crisis comes, bank reposes the property of lender as it cannot pay and keep the house with them and sells under a foreclosure scheme.

Middle class are good target as they are shown dream and virtually they fall for the lies.

This only happens in countries which print money and create debts like EU, US, Japan etc.

Any one who is financial acumen will not fall in the trap.

Intresting question, well a lot of people in US buy in mortgage because the price of a real estate is high. I think evem wealthy people do the same thats the mentality of american it nothing bad if they have money then buy easy but if they dont have much, but they know they can upscale why not taking it for mortgage

Even wealthy peoples are doing the same thing, They rent out their extra property to corporate level organizations.

Q$Q$Q
How does the US mortgage interest tax deduction work?
A$A$A
I agree with Wray and Mike 100%. I'll add a little extra food for thought:

Itemized deductions, such as qualified mortgage interest and real estate taxes actually paid, are subject to reduced tax benefits as your income grows.

Itemized deductions phaseout (also called "pease") begin to impact single filers with AGI at $150k.

Additionally, AMT can kick in frequently for those making over $100k with high itemized deductions (like state and local income taxes).

I think huge misconception is that mortgage interest is always just "written off." While taxpayers certainly have every right to list mortgage interest and property taxes as itemized deductions, that doesn't automatically mean they get the full tax benefit.

It's important to do your homework (and not just this year but going forward if you are expecting changes in your income). If you end up finding out about this too late, selling a house is a costly (and painstaking) transaction.
A$A$A
I should add that there are some limits on the mortgage interest deduction. You can only deduct the interest on the first $1 million of what is called acquisition debt (the amount you spent to build, buy, or substantially improve your home) and the interest on the first $100K of equity debt (a loan secured by the home that is made for reasons other than to build, buy, or substantially improve the home, which can include the amount in excess of $1 million in acquisition debt). If you were to later tap into the $240K of equity you put in to borrow, say, $150K to buy a custom speedboat or something, you would only be able to deduct 2/3 of that interest.

If you are married filing separately, these limits are halved.
A$A$A
First, 240K amounts to 30% NOT 20% so your remaining loan balance will be $560k or 70% of 800k.

if we assume your APR is somewhere at 5% and property tax 1.25%

so this gives you for the first year effectively $28k that you'll have to pay to the bank for just living in your house and them giving you a loan.

so let's say if your income is 100k a year your net taxes will be ~$28K if you're single with no dependents.

now let's say with the house that you bought and deducting the interest your net taxes will be about $19k so saves you about 10k.

so $28k you pay to the bank for interest will give you $9k savings in taxes.

100k(gross)-20k(tax)-28k(interest)-10k(property taxes) remainder is $42k or $3.5k/month for everything else including your food, retirement savings, entertainments, maintenance and insurance on the house, car, maintenance and insurance.. so it's a little over $100 a day you have for all this.

anyway, the point is if there is no appreciation of the house buying one is not a good deal if prices are flat and won't pay off in the short term by just living in it.
A$A$A
It works like this.  When you pay interest on your mortgage, you deduct that from your income.  Whatever tax bracket you are in, that is the percentage of money that you will save on your mortgage interest.  If you pay $5,000 in interest, you can deduct $5,000 from your income.  If you made $100,000 in income, then your mortgage interest will reduce your taxable income to $95,000.  Thus saving you taxes on $5,000 worth of income. 

Be aware that this only works if your itemize your deductions.  There is a standard deduction that everyone gets and I believe its $6,300 per person.  you can visit the IRS website to determine what other deductions you might have to determine if you'll itemize your deductions. 

A great resource on mortgage interest is this mortgage calculator that helps you understand the mortgage interest tax deduction as you pay off your mortgage.  You should also consult your CPA or tax accountant to know for sure. 
A$A$A
The way the deduction works is you can deduct as an itemized deduction the interest you pay on your mortgage.  In your example you would pay out $36,000 in the first year that is approximately a 5% APR so your interest in the first year is about $28,000 which is the amount you can deduct from your income to calculate taxable income.
A$A$A
Accepting we are talking US tax collection, any citizen that claims a home can deduct the intrigue part of their home loan inside specific points of confinement as a separated derivation when they document their government singular expense form.If this is a home based business, the taxpayer may also qualify to take a portion of the interest expense as a home office expense deduction.

Q$Q$Q
Why are US mortgage rates going up after the election?
A$A$A
Most mortgages are sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Those mortgages are then pooled into a type of bond called a Mortgage Backed Security (MBS). These bonds are bought and sold just like any other type of bond. When there is selling pressure, the price of the bond goes down. The converse is also true.

Mortgage rates are directly correlated to the price of the MBS, because they will indicate to the lenders what they can sell a loan for today. Lenders look at the price of the MBS each day to prepare their daily rate sheets. They keep an eye on the MBS market during the day to know whether they should issue revised rate sheets in the event of an unexpected price move up or down.

The normal movement of the MBS market is about 10–25 basis points each day, up or down. One basis point is one cent per $100 of bond value.

When the price of the MBS goes up by, say, 25 basis points, the rate for mortgages will go down by about 1/16 percent (bond price and rate move in opposite directions).

Because MBS are a fixed-income investment, they are highly sensitive to inflation—or fears of inflation, because a inflation erodes the purchasing power of the dollar, and therefor the attractiveness of bonds.

On the Wednesday after the election. MBS sold off heavily, losing 66 basis points. Selling continued on Thursday, with MBS shedding 56. On Monday, the loss was 43. The selling abated slightly this week, but the total loss was 232 basis points. This meant that interest rates increased rapidly by about .75%.

The reason for this financial bloodbath (as far as rates are concerned) is that the President-Elect’s economic policies, to the extent that he has articulated any, is widely viewed as being inflationary—they would add something over $10 trillion to the debt over a comparatively short period. The bond sell-off was exacerbated by the movement of money from bonds into equities (stocks) in the belief that stocks would rally with the increased infrastructure spending. This became a sort of self-fulfilling prophesy.

It appears that the bond market overreacted somewhat by the results of the election—bonds HATE surprises. They are presently in a condition called “oversold” and are recovering somewhat. As of this morning (11/22/16) MBS have recovered 47 basis points. This is a short and lightly traded week, so price movement is often exaggerated. It is likely that we’ll see some continuing improvement next week (lower rates) even if they don’t return to the historically low levels we saw before the election.

Here is a graphical representation of the MBS action leading up to and following the election. Red bars, obviously, are days where the price declined.
A$A$A
Mr Stinnett is partially correct. The Interest rate is closely tied to the Stock Market (people are looking for a rate of return. If the return for stocks goes up, the returns for everything, even safe investments, goes up). In addition, President Trump’s economic plan calls for YUGE deficits, perhaps as much as 2 trillion a year, if he gets everything he wants. That happens when you cut taxes, and plan to spend BIG on infrastructure, the military, and the Great Wall of Gina. Large government debt means large government borrowing. Large Government Borrowing means higher interest rates. The market is also acting in anticipation of President Trump’s taking action on his promises.
A$A$A
US mortgage rates are benchmarked to the 10-year US Treasury. That rate is determined by market forces. 10-year Treasury yields have been trending downward for the last 30 years, and have been trading in a relatively tight range since the financial crisis of 2008.

Trump campaigned on infrastructure spending and tax cuts for the wealthy, something that he should now have very little trouble passing through a Republican Congress. However, he cannot have tax cuts and increased spending on the level that he has proposed without massively increasing the debt, as there is not enough discretionary spending to offset these plans. As more debt is anticipated, the market is driving down the price of the 10-year Treasury, which pushes up its yield.

As mortgages are benchmarked to the 10-year Treasury, market rates will follow the general trend in Treasury yields.
A$A$A
US Mortgage rates are more closely tied to the stock market and the 10 year bond… If the stock market goes down the rates go down. If the stock market goes up the rates go up. That is a very basic and historical way the rates work. Since the market has been doing well since the election and there is a positive outlook in the market, the rates are up. I can explain why they are tied to each other. But that’s it in a nutshell.
A$A$A
The Fed has held the interest rates low due to political pressure. Instead, more money has been printed and handed over to financial institutions to keep the economy limping along. They have to come back up in order to mesh with reality, and it’ll probably happen in the first few months of the next Presidency. Thus, mortgage rates will rise as well.

How many mortgage pools are there in the US mortgage market by agencies?
A$A$A
In the GSE space, Loans are assembled into groups of similar features. (term, origination date, interest rate, credit quality) and securitized into Pools, in that process a sliver of interest is peeled off and paid to FRE, FNM, as an insurance premium so that if a loan goes bad, FRE/FNM buy the offending loan out of the pool at face value. The market quotes pricing for the entire cohort of pools (rate, term, guarantor) w/ similar stats, and all of those pools are deliverable into that generic bid.

About 300 loans create a pool, there are north of 1 million individual pools but they are quoted in roughly 3 groups (FRE/FNM/GNM), 7 rates (2.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,5), 2 original terms (15y and 30y) and 6 vintages (2012 thru 2017). There are of course other subsets (20y, older vintages, higher and lower cpns, Adjustable rates, etc.) but these cover the vast majority of the market.

Those tickers in your question denote guarantor and original term (FH30y), an example TBA price quote would be FH 30y 3.5% for May Settle. Many, many pools fit the delivery guidelines of that TBA bid.

I’ll try to grab a table showing the exact breakdown of loans/pools per guarantor etc.

(BTW, Pools get aggregated into larger pools as well as ReSecuritizarions that create various classes of securities w/ competing payment priorities relative to one another. The REMIC market)
