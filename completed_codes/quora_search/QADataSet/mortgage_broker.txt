What is a mortgage broker?
A$A$A
Hi,

A mortgage broker is essentially a middleman between the borrower/homeowner and the bank or mortgage lender. They work directly with both the consumer and the bank to help borrowers qualify for a mortgage, whether it be a purchase mortgage or a refinance.

Borrower/Homeowner <— Mortgage Broker —> Bank/Mortgage Lender

I'll answer this question for people who are doing business in the United States.  There are three main types mortgage companies:

1) A depository bank such as Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo. There are other smaller, state-chartered banks but you get the idea. These entities offer checking and savings, personal loans, and mortgage loans. 

2) A non-bank lender. Many years ago, we use to just call them "mortgage companies."  A non-bank (or non-depository) lender is a company that offers mortgage loans and does NOT offer banking services like checking or savings accounts.  Some large regional non-depository lenders in the U.S.: Guild Mortgage, Caliber Home Loans, Cornerstone Home Lending.  These huge, regional mortgage lenders have contracts with banks and other large lenders and this is where the money comes from to fund their loans.

3) Mortgage brokers do not lend money. 

FOR A FEE, the mortgage broker FINDS the mortgage money on your behalf. Because of this, think of a mortgage broker as a middleman.  In some states, a  loan originator who works under a mortgage broker may owe fiduciary duties to his/her clients.  This prescribes a very high duty of care, good faith, fair dealings, and complete honesty/transparency regarding fee income.  If you need more info on the how/why of the fiduciary nature of this relationship, ask me to answer in a separate question.

Depository banks want their loan originators to sell only the mortgage programs and products offered by the bank.  Non-bank mortgage lenders also want their loan originators to focus on offering the mortgage programs and products offered through their lending channels.  A loan originator (LO) who works under a mortgage broker has access to the same types of products that the bank and lenders offer, and in addition, a mortgage broker LO also has access to all the lending programs that his company is contracted to do business with. Yay!  This goes way beyond what is offered at a depository bank or non-bank lender.

A consumer will never see the wholesale cost of mortgage money.  One way to get a glimpse into the mortgage broker world would be to take a look at this industry website:

Scotsman Guide: The Leading Resource for Mortgage Originators

There are other ways to obtain a mortgage loan.  Credit unions would technical fall under the first "depository" category.  There are other sources of mortgage money like private or "hard money" lenders that fill a need if your financial situation or property type doesn't fit what the main 3 have to offer.  But a mortgage broker should be able to "shop" on your behalf and find a lender that will serve your needs.

NOTE:

Non-bank lenders will often allow their loan originators to broker loans when needed.  This is the best of both words.  A hybrid: Lender/broker.  Years ago they would have called themselves banker/broker but since they do not offer banking services, a more honest way of describing this hybrid-type of company is: lender/broker.

NOTE 2:

All loan originators in the United States are required to be either registered or licensed, and supervised by an entity: Bank, non-bank lender, or mortgage broker.  You can check the status of the loan originator by searching this public records database:

A mortgage broker acts as a middleman between you and potential lenders. The broker’s job is to work on your behalf with several banks to find the best mortgage lenders who best fit your needs with the lowest rates. Mortgage brokers have a well-developed stable of lenders they work with, making your life easier.

Independent mortgage agent are licensed and regulated financial professionals. They do all the legwork — from gathering documents from you to pulling your credit history and verifying your income and employment — and use the information to apply for loans on your behalf with several lenders in a short time frame.

Once you settle on a loan and a lender that works best for you, your mortgage broker will collaborate with the bank’s underwriting department, the closing agent (usually the title company), and your real estate agent to keep the transaction running smoothly through closing day.

There are many things to consider when it comes to mortgages and ways you can reduce your amortization. This includes the following options:

Increasing the frequency of your mortgage payments

Increasing the amount of your payments

Paying additional amounts on your payment dates

Making lump sum payments

Selecting a shorter amortization at renewal time

Hope you have got this clear :)

A  Mortgage Broker is a GO BETWEEN MAN for banks, or a wholeseller, if you  will. The Mortgage Broker acts like a lender when you give them the  first loan with your signature on the Mortgage promissory Note and  Mortgage lien Contract. They make you think that THEY, the Mortgage  Broker, is the real lender.

A Mortgage Broker is a go-between between the borrower and the lender who negotiates the loan on your behalf. Well, once a borrower makes contact with a mortgage broker and agrees to work with him or her, the broker will gather important information. Income, asset, and employment documentation, along with a credit report, are necessary to assess the borrower’s ability to obtain financing.

I'll answer this question for the Canadians, and it is quite a different answer.

In Canada we have a handful of National Chartered Banks, dozens of smaller Provincially regulated Credit Unions, and non-bank lenders – the virtual sort acting much like an ING operation but offering mortgages only. All of these lenders focus on AAA applicants, and nearly all accept applications presented to them by independent Mortgage Brokers acting in the best interested of the applicants.

KEY POINT – In Canada Mortgage Brokers bringing applications to lenders such as those listed above are paid not by clients, but by the lenders, just as the lenders own team of representatives are, based on mortgage size and length of term.

Mortgage Brokers in Canada typically only charge a fee to the applicant in the case of ‘B-lending’ or Private lending. The higher rate second mortgage situations for instance. Personally this represents less than 3% of my business each year.

Previously considered lenders of last resort, Mortgage Brokers in Canada have reinvented themselves as the go-to point of contact for AAA clients looking not only for the sharpest rates with the least hassle, but also for unbiased independent advice.

You call a Mortgage Broker in Canada because you want to, and you know to, not because you have to.

A mortgage broker is essentially a conduit between the lender (usually a bank) and you. Their first job is to assess your economical affairs, put together a picture of your credit-worthiness, and help you determine what type of house loan economical loan will be right for you. They should then provide you a variety of house loan economical loan choices from the panel of house loan economical loan creditors they act for.

Mortgage brokers generally provide economical products from a number of different banking institutions, not all of the creditors on the market. Because they connect numerous products, they will almost certainly connect something that suits your needs and they can spend the time with you to understand what your goals are, to explain the choices, and to help you with the paperwork. They can potentially provide you with a very useful service.

Like any industry though, the service quality can vary from person to person. Also be aware that – much as a real estate broker is performing on the part of owner and not the customer – mortgage broker are performing on the part of owner of the borrowed funds (the economical institution) and not you as the customer.

A mortgage broker is a professional, who has a license to help property buyers find an investor, who lends money to the property buyer mortgaging any of his (buyer/borrower’s) expensive assets, such as house, car or jewelleries.

In the process, mortgage broker earns money from the borrower in terms of FEE. Or the case could be this way also – Mortgage broker would take no FEE or the borrower has to face any out-of-pocket costs, all that the borrower has to pay is an INCREASED INTEREST RATE.

A mortgage broker gathers paperwork from a borrower and passes that paperwork along to a mortgage lender for underwriting and approval. The mortgage funds are lent in the name of the mortgage lender, and the mortgage broker collects an origination fee from the lender as compensation for services. A mortgage broker is not to be confused with a mortgage banker, which closes and funds a mortgage with its own funds.

A mortgage broker is an intermediary working with a borrower and a lender while qualifying the borrower for a mortgage.

Q$Q$Q
How many mortgage brokers are there in Georgia?
A$A$A
You're confusing "Realtors" with "Real Estate Agents". Just because you're a real estate agent, doesn't mean you're a Realtor (a Realtor must be an agent or broker, but the inverse isn't necessarily true).

Realtors are agents/brokers that belong to the National Association of Realtors. There are approximately 2.5M real estate agents/brokers in the U.S., but only a subset of them (about 1.2M) are members of NAR.
A$A$A
There are just over 900k residential Realtors as of this quarter, the number will be back up to 1M by early 2013.

Regarding commercial, NAR just informed me "Approximately 78,000 NAR and institute affiliate members specialize in commercial brokerage and related services. Also, an additional 232,000 members offer commercial real estate services as a secondary business."
A$A$A
I work in Orange County, California, where the Orange County Assoc of Realtors regularly reports that a surprising percentage of their members complete no - zero - transactions for the previous year: the average now is four. Many are in the business on a part-time basis. It appears some may keep their license active 'just in case' while pursuing other careers. This could explain the lower Dept of Labor number.
A$A$A
The spread likely alludes to the fact that while may people are realtors, only a small percentage of them are actually listing properties at any given time. NAR membership may be a requirement of holding a real-estate license (believe MLS is the same way).

Additionally, and somewhat unrelated, your question & facts are very interesting considering the US has only 129,000 brokerages which suggests that either most are small or the distribution is very inconsistent inconsistent (e.g. 5 large brokers, thousands of small ones.
A$A$A
My friend is a realtor and he's not too happy with all the money he has to spend on annual dues. I think more realtors will choose to be an agent so they don't have to spend as much annually. I created a program that pays real estate agents/realtors while enhancing RESPA.

According to statistics from the National Association of Realtors. The number of real estate agents has dropped over 26% in less than 5 years and is now less than a million.  The number has gone down every year.  Even the construction workers have not gone down this severe!

Q$Q$Q
How does one find a competitive, trustworthy mortgage broker online?
A$A$A
There are different mortgage brokers, lenders and places where a prospective buyer can get a mortgage to purchase his dream home, but the most important question is to decide what type of mortgage will suit you. Making a decision on where, which and how to secure financing used to purchase a home is one of the important decision of the buying process. Now everything is online, so you just need to check your eligibility by simply filling up a simple form online. Check 15 Minute Mortgage Application here - Apply For Mortgage Loan. Besides I am going to jot down few important points here -

Eight ways to help you find the best mortgage lender

Getting a good credit score is important to securing a mortgage at a fair rate. The higher is the credit score, the more negotiating power a customer has.

Credit scores tools are credit score tracking, down payment assistance, debt consolidation that can help you find your dream home quick and easy.

Know the changing scenario in mortgage lending landscape from giant banks to Independent mortgage agents who can offer more mortgage products, better interest rates than big banks

Get preapproval for your mortgage. Pre-approved for a mortgage means that the mortgage agent has studied all your credit and financial history and has sanctioned to provide you mortgage. Securing a pre-approval increases the chances of being granted a loan. Shopping around with lenders for a home before getting preapproved for a mortgage is equal to walking in a shopping mall without caring your wallet.

Since loans is available in different sizes, and interest rates, always compare rates of several mortgage agents. Comparison can help in determining which type and terms of loan is most suited for you, different loan payment options, and breakdown of several loan mortgage fees.

Simply research online for potential and best mortgage agents near me which provides knowledge and insight into a company’s terms and policies.

Ask for recommendations from your friends, family or peers who have had hired mortgage service for home or property buying or planning to do so.

Always ensure to ask the right questions to the mortgage advisor and read the fine print. Get a detailed knowledge about your loan payments, loan terms, documents required, any hidden costs involved and the interest rates. Asking the right questions to the agents is very much important to get the best mortgage that suits your requirements.
A$A$A
The best way to find a mortgage broker is through a referral.  That being said, you can use the internet to find brokers that seem to have knowledge of the type of transaction you are seeking, then interview them carefully to make sure your initial impression is true.

I founded Inzopa to help consumers connect with the perfect local mortgage brokers based on past transactions (relevant and competitive) and Yelp (trustworthy) ratings. We can help you, right away, if you are based in San Francisco Bay Area.

Try out https://www.inzopa.com
A$A$A
I take it to mean you wish to use on-line resources to identify a trustworthy mortgage broker.

You could start with the National Association of Mortgage Brokers (NAMB) website and identify professionals who serve the area where you wish to purchase a home and then use Yelp etc to check reputations. I believe that to be a sub-optimal strategy.

I always start with people that I trust and ask them who they trust. So, if you have a CPA (or attorney or financial planner or...) that you trust, ask that CPA who they trust. Easy Schmeezy.

If you are moving to another state, it just adds one degree of separation.
A$A$A
To find a trustworthy broker, I suggest searching for “mortgage broker” on Yelp and Zillow to find someone with good reviews. A simple Google search for “mortgage broker [your city/town]” will show mortgage brokers on a map in your area with reviews. Look for mortgage brokers with high ratings and good reviews, verified by other’s first-hand experience.

My advice is to identify the 3 best reviewed mortgage brokers you can find. Call each one and ask the Top 15 Questions to Ask a Mortgage Lender or Broker Before You Apply For a Mortgage Loan. After you ask the broker these questions, it will give you a good idea on how they operate and if they will serve you throughout the process. If you leave a message and the broker does not call you back, find someone else.

The most important characteristic of a competitive mortgage broker is that they are responsive and able to return your call or email in a timely manner. Timing is everything throughout the home-buying process.
A$A$A
You can always check the BBB, Yelp and other social media outlets. What's most important is to understand how to read your Good Faith Estimate - if you know what you're looking for you can't be over charged. I've written two pieces you might find interesting: How to shop for a mortgage: Mortgage Loan Shopping    How to read your Good Faith: Mortgage Good Faith Estimates

Your ideal mortgage broker should have a firm understanding of their business,  have some relevant educational background, and be an active, full-time  mortgage professional with at least a few years of industry experience.If you are from canada,then One indication you can watch for in your search for a mortgage broker,  is the AMP designation. Launched by the Canadian Association of  Accredited Mortgage Professionals (CAAMP) in 2004, “the Accredited  Mortgage Professional (AMP) is the national designation for Canada’s  mortgage industry”

Definitely avoid any website that appears to be a lead generation form. Since you want to work online and not f2f then the mortgage broker you work with will need to understand this and will already BE online. 

Do a google search in your town.  Check the company's complete social, online presence: website, blog, facebook, twitter, zillow, etc.  Interact with that person online.  Ask the person some simple questions about your needs and see if the person treats you like a human or like a nothingburger.  I highly recommend that even though you want to work with someone online, you work with someone in your town.  There's something to be said for being able to drive to his/her office if needed. 

And finally make sure the loan originator is licensed to do business in your state by checking the NMLS registry: http://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org/

Hi, there are many competitive brokers online, however, the process of finding a reliable can be a tricky task. In my perspective you should consider visiting http://www.nanaimosmortgageexper.... I have dealt with Nanaimos Mortgage Experts and they seem to be reliable ones.

Comments about Brokers on the web are rarely 100% accurate, whether they be positive or negative. As was mentioned referrals are the best (I receive almost 100% of my business from referrals), What you should do is strive to contact various brokers personally to get a feel as to how knowledgeable they are and how easy they are to work with. Most brokers have access to all the same types of products as other brokers, so in the end it comes down to whether or not you feel that they truly are looking out for YOU or if they're just looking out for their own interests. There is no substitute for personal contact, even in todays digital age.
A$A$A
When choosing a mortgage broker it is important to find someone you trust because if you are doing something like buying a home you will likely have a mortgage payment for 15+ years. There are several resources online for finding mortgage brokers in your area. Doing a search on google for brokers in your area that specialize in what you’re looking for is a great starting point for getting a feel of what some of your options are. Once you have done that, looking for references is going to give you the best results for a competitive and trustworthy mortgage broker. To start you off, we recommend Sammamish Mortgage located in Bellevue, WA. Here are a few reasons why Sammamish Mortgage is a good choice:

To answer your question one can NOT. That isn't because mortgage brokers are untrustworthy it has to do with the commission tiers they sign up for when they start their employment with those lenders. It also has to do with how competitive that lender’s rates actually are. This makes for a mind boggling combo of rates and cost.

This is the reason why 10 different loan officer can offer 10 different rates and cost from the very same lender.

Borrowers must know the lowest rate and cost they can qualify for (Par pricing) and then reach the largest footprint of loan officers in order to get that. Hope that helps

It is unlikely that online search alone will tell the whole story, 99% of my clients come to me through referral by family, friends, coworkers, etc.  Of the few that find me online, it is that first ten minutes of verbal conversation where you know whether you will be a good fit for each other.  Was the PHone number easy to find, was teh called answered first time, or at least returned the same day? Has the broker explained clearly what is it they actually do for you?  Have they answered any and all questions you have asked clearly and patiently?  These things are the first signs as to whether you are on the right track or not.

There are a lot of mortgage brokers that you can find online. I would personally look at testimonials, the years of experience they have. Make sure they can be found or contacted easily. Not sure where you are located, but here in Toronto, I have used http://www.omj.ca OMJ Mortgage Brokerage Company. They are pretty good at what they do, and I would definitely recommend them.

You can also check out the National Association of Mortgage Brokers.

Whether the broker was referred by a family member or you found him online, I would still recommend to interview the broker before hiring them. I would also make sure they are registered, and looking to support the interests of the buyer.

Q$Q$Q
How do I differentiate between mortgage brokers and loan officers?
A$A$A
NO the terms ARE NOT interchangeable.

A mortgage broker is a middleman. A mortgage broker does not make or fund loans. A mortgage broker seeks and finds the source of the mortgage money on behalf of his or her client and for that the broker earns a fee. 

State law will govern the licensing requirements of a mortgage broker. It sounds like you might be interested in commercial loans if you're doing business lending or business "brokering" so make that differentiation before you research your state's laws governing residential or commercial mortgage brokerages.

There will always be a designated broker named who will be responsible for the conduct of those who work for the brokerage.  

A loan officer is a term that no longer exists today.

Instead we say:

Licensed Loan Originator

or

Registered Loan Originator.

A registered loan originator is an employee of a depository bank.

A licensed loan originator works either: under the supervision of a mortgage broker OR at a non-bank mortgage lender (also under the supervision of his/her branch manager.)

Your state law will outline the licensing requirements for a loan originator who works for a business-type brokerage firm. 

Federal law governs licensing for loan originators who are originating loans for residential homes. 

Hope that helps! Let me know if you need anything else.
A$A$A
The terms loan officer and mortgage broker are often used without distinction to describe professionals who originate home loans. In some jurisdictions, however, licensing requirements actually make a distinction between the two.

“Loan Officer” is mostly used to describe finance professionals who origination mortgages exclusively for their employer. For example, a retail mortgage loan officer in a Bank of America call center can only offer loan products issued by his or her employer. In some cases, however, loan officers may work for a mortgage loan origination firm that offers products from multiple lenders. In most states, these loan officers require registration in the National Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS) and proof of professional education.

“Mortgage Broker” is mostly used to describe business-minded finance professionals who enjoy working on their own. The state oversight and licensing requirements for these professionals are usually stricter than for loan officers. Mortgage brokers tend to do their own marketing; they also forge alliances with different lenders and tend to profit off basis point on each loan closed. Mortgage brokers sometimes work as loan officers.

The term loan officer can also be used in other settings, such as in business loan brokerages, auto financing operations, commercial banks, etc.

Mortgage brokers come into contact with real estate investors and other finance-minded business people, which might be the reason you are getting some mortgage brokers interested in closing business loans. Unless your line of business requires special licensing at the federal and/or state level, you should welcome mortgage brokers and their black book of clients; otherwise, you can specify that you prefer to not deal with them.

Mortgage Brokers

Mortgage brokers are independent consultants who work for both the homeowner and the mortgage lender. In other words, they act as a facilitator to help bridge the gap between you and the lender. They don’t loan you the money but instead find a lender who will lend it to you.

Advertisement

When you begin the process, the broker has you fill out an application to get an idea of your financial situation and then pulls your credit. They then take your credit score and information to various lenders to find loan options for you to choose from. Once you settle on a loan option, they work with the lender on your behalf until you close.

Pros

They develop relationships with many different lenders and institutions and are able to “shop around” to find you the best loan for your needs.

They can be better for people with low credit scores. The broker may be able to find a lender who is willing to work with less-than-perfect credit.

They do all the legwork when it comes to the mortgage – finding options, filing paperwork, etc.

Cons

It can be time-consuming and difficult to work with a “middleman.”

You have to pay a commission to the broker at closing.

It can be difficult to know if you’re being overcharged because you’re only dealing with an independent contractor.

It’s important to remember that if you work with a mortgage broker, they are going to find you the best option from the lenders they have a relationship with – they aren’t looking at options from every lender. For this reason, although they’re doing a lot of the work for you and have a lot of knowledge and experience that you might not have, they could be limiting your options.

If you decide to work with a broker, make sure to read reviews, and if possible, choose someone a friend or family member has worked with. When you find a broker, ask about their experience level, the type of relationships they have with lenders and any licenses and training they might have.

Loan Officers

A loan officer is an agent employed by a lending institution. They work directly with the homeowners to take them through the mortgage process. They’re also called mortgage bankers, Home Loan Experts, mortgage planners, mortgage consultants and mortgage loan originators, according to Mohan Cheema-Best Home Loan Officer in Fresno, USA- 559-905-2575 Reputed Loan Officer in USA

Like a mortgage broker, a loan officer is going to have you fill out an application and pull your credit report to get an understanding of your financial situation. The loan officer will then recommend the best loan for you out of their company’s loan options.

Pros

Working with a loan officer means you’re cutting out the middleman and dealing directly with the mortgage lender.

Homeowners don’t have to pay a commission to loan officers.

You have more control over your own finances than you would if you were simply following the advice of a mortgage broker.

Cons

Loans options are based only on that loan officer’s company.

You’re expected to do more of the work to provide the lender with the details of your situation and mortgage.

Some lending institutions have large teams of people you’ll be working with, so the service can be impersonal.

The borrower should know what type of home is desired, how much they qualify for and what their budget affords. Those constraints can determine the mortgage type and term.

The lender receives an appraisal of the property and this appraisal determines the market value of the home, which is used for collateral in the loan. The borrower is charged a fee for the appraisal service and is usually included in the closing costs.

When the mortgage application is complete, the borrower will be asked for a considerable amount of information. That is why the borrower should be prepared to give the lender the following information:

Bank information such as the name, address, account numbers, and three months of statements.

Three months of investment statements.

W-2s, pay stubs, proof of employment and two years worth of income.

Tax returns and balance sheets for the self-employed.

Debt currently owed, including amounts due and account numbers.

Divorce papers, if they apply.

Many of us confused with both these terms. Here I have stated some differences;

Difference 1:

Loan officer is a person who works directly for a bank or a lender but mortgage broker is an independent worker who acts as a middle man between the home buyer and the lender.

Difference 2:

Loan officer is not required license to work in the mortgage industry but a mortgage broker required licensed to work in the mortgage industry.

Difference 3:

A loan officer’s main objective is about the best interest of their employer not home buyer but the main objective of mortgage broker is that getting lower credits for home buyers.

Difference 4:

Loan officers paid to write loans for their company but mortgage brokers get paid a percentage of amounts after closing a mortgage.

A mortgage broker (either a group or an individual) is an independent agent for both the mortgage loan applicant and the lender. Your mortgage broker will stand as facilitate between you and the lending institution; which may be a bank, trust company, credit union, mortgage corporation, finance company or even a private investor. A mortgage broker can review your finances to find out which lender is the best fit for your loan needs. From application to closing, your mortgage broker facilitates the loan process: submitting your loan application to a number of lenders, and walking you with the chosen lender through to closing. The borrower gives a commission to the broker if the loan closes.

Loan Officers

Loan officers work for a specific lending institution (such as a bank) who work with mortgages and other lending programs on behalf of their company alone. They may be able to offer loans to fit many different situations, but all the loans will be products of the same lender.

A loan officer (also called an "account executive" or "loan representative") represents the borrower to the lending institution.
A$A$A
A mortgage banker and a independent mortgage broker can both help you get a home loan. A mortgage banker or loan officers works for a bank or similar lending institution which actually provides you the money for the loan. A mortgage broker doesn't represent one institution, but works with many to shop for a loan for a specific individual. The banker is a direct lender. The broker is a middleman between you and the lender. The jobs are similar and the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics lists both as "loan officers" with similar functions and pay.

The term is sometimes used interchangeably. Often, individuals referred to as a mortgage broker is simply a loan originator. Technically though, a mortgage originator is one who is licensed by the National Mortgage Licensing System to solicit and originate applications for mortgage loans. Everyone engaging in that activity must complete Federal and State educational requirements and pass Federal and State Exams. If they are successful, they are considered a Licensed Mortgage Originator.  All accept bank employees must complete this requirement. Theoretically speaking then, Bank Employees would be less qualified in this area since they are able to escape this rigorous procedure.

A Mortgage Broker would be an Loan or Mortgage Originator that does not work for a direct lender.  This individual would place your loan application with a Mortgage Banker who would approve and provide you with funding for your loan.  Even though funding for your loan comes from the mortgage banker, at times, even they will sell your loan to another institution right after closing.

I have working in the mortgage banking industry for the 22 years.  We are licensed in all 50 states and are direct lenders.  We offer FHA, VA, and Conventional loans. Some programs require no down payment.

Q$Q$Q
What is mortgage broker fee?
A$A$A
A mortgage broker is legally called an “originator” as compared to a mortgage banker, who is referred to as a “creditor.” Practically, there is no difference apart from the fact that the broker is legally required to disclose his or her compensation, while bankers are not.

Both brokers and bankers receive compensation for their work. The difference is the route through which they get paid. A broker can choose to be paid by the lender or by the borrower. If the broker is paid by the borrower, he or she typically will select an interest rate that generates a rebate from the lender that fully or partially offsets the broker fee. You should look on your Loan Estimate (a document the lender is legally required to give you whether they are broker or banker) and see if there is a lender credit to offset some or all of the broker’s compensation. If there is no lender credit (technically called the “yield spread premium”) you should determine whether the rate the broker is offering you is lower than you would get from a banker when you pay no discount points (one “point” is on percent of the loan amount, and can be used to lower the interest rate).

If the broker is offering you a rate that is the same as that offered by other lenders, you should have a heart-to-heart conversation with them to see whether you are being overcharged.

You should be aware that all lenders adjust the rates that appear on their rate sheets according to credit scores, loan-to-value ratio, type of property and other factors. You should be able to get the same rate from a broker that you would get from a banker for the same type of loan.

You should sit down with the broker and have him go over all the fees on the estimate. You should know what rates other lenders are offering for loans similar to yours. The broker should be able to explain to you in detail why each fee exists—and, if your rate is higher, how it is justified.

Good luck!

Generally speaking, mortgage brokers don’t charge you a fee, although some do, so it’s important to shop around and make sure you’re getting the best deal possible. There are heaps of mortgage brokers who don’t charge you a thing - so there’s really no reason to be paying unnecessary fees.

Although fees aren’t usually something you’ll have to take into account when choosing a mortgage broker, you do have to consider how they’re getting paid, because it can have an effect on your home loan and what advice they give you.

So how do mortgage brokers make their money?

Mortgage brokers are people too - they need to feed their families and pay their bills. They’re not helping you negotiate a better home loan deal from the goodness of their hearts. Brokers usually work on commission, which can come in two parts: the upfront commission and an recurring monthly commission.

The upfront commission is the most common, and the amount varies from lender to lender, between 0.3-0.7% of the loan value. So, for example, if you ended up taking out a $500,000 home loan, and your broker was working on a 0.5% commission, they would make $2,500 straight up.
A$A$A
Following are the ways in which mortgage broker take their fees:

Fixed fee. Your adviser will agree to arrange your mortgage for a fixed amount of money.

Hourly rate- Some advisers will charge per hour.

Commission- If a mortgage adviser is fee free, they may be receiving payment in the form of commission from the lender.

Percentage- Some advisers will charge you a percentage of your mortgage.

A combination- Some advisers will charge fees but still receive commission. Others will charge fees, but agree to cap them at a percentage of the mortgage. Contractor Mortgage Uk
A$A$A
The lender credit is a premium the broker is getting for giving you a specific interest rate.

This is the salary of the mortgage broker, and fair warning, it can be negotiated in advance, when approached accordingly.

They get paid a fee, also called origination points, in addition to a premium the bank offers them for selling you a specific interest rate. This is the time where you decide what is more important for you:

The lowest interest rate possible (and pay the cost of origination fees upfront from your pocket at closing)

The interest rate he is offering you (it could be higher, to justify his commission, plus whatever you are paying upfront)

Honesty, communicating whats more important to you opens the conversation and it will offer you options.

Best of luck.
A$A$A
Yes, the mortgage broker fee is how they make money. You can refuse to pay for it all you want, but you do pay for it one way or another on every loan. Your mortgage broker just gave you the courtesy of disclosing it to you. In this case, you're financing the mortgage broker fee instead of paying out of pocket.

Your real estate broker should be able to explain all this to you if you have any further questions.
A$A$A
Depends if the mortgage adviser is operating directly for the banks or through an umbrella company. It's usually 0.45 to 0.85% depending on the bank, deal taken and amount of loan.

Q$Q$Q
How much salary do mortgage broker earns?
A$A$A
Mortgage Brokers are typically business owners, and do not work on salary, they are self employed. When a person sets up their business, they should get with a VERY GOOD CPA and decide how to pay themselves.

It also depends upon how the company is set up, LLC, LLP, Sole Prop.

The short answers, we get paid on what ever is left over after all the bills and taxes are paid, sometimes the month is really good, and sometimes the month is ZIP.
A$A$A
If you are asking this question, you probably do not mean mortgage broker. I am answering this question for people located in the United States.

You probably are meaning to ask "how much does a licensed loan originator make who works for a mortgage broker?"

Loan originators can be paid in may ways: A base salary, by the hour, per transaction, etc., but for the most part, loan originators negotiate a percentage of the loan amount for each transaction. So for example, for a $200,000 loan, you could negotiate 1 percent of the loan amount. On this transaction you would earn $2,000.

So the amount you make each month will be determined on how many loans you close each month. 

There are other ways to negotiate a starting salary when you're brand new. Interview with several companies in your town before accepting a job so you get a feel for your salary options. If you're brand new you will need to rely on the support of the staff to help you with all the questions you'll have during the first 40 or 50 years of your career so keep that in mind.  Nobody does this job in a vacuum, all by themselves. We all rely on each other to help us get the transaction through from application to closing. 

Good luck!

The mortgage salary varies depending on location, company, experience, profit etc. Average salary may vary from $80,000 to $90,000. For more information check out on Mortgage Consultants Toronto | Accredited Mortgage Professionals & Mortgage Brokers | Butler Mortgage

There are two models: Straight commission or salary based.

Salary based would pay you a base salary with bonuses on closed business. Great model to learn the business and if you aren't risky in terms of income.

100% commission model is just that: eat what you kill.

If you have zero experience in finance or sales, you can pretty much gaurantee your first two years will be brutal and low as far as income.

You'll have to find a Brokerage that will pay a decent split but offer underwriting support with your deals.

Average Mortgage Broker will likely make less than $50k per year.

If you treat it like a business, then you'll grow that income over many years. Good luck!

Mortgage Broker Salary (United States)
A$A$A
Unlike loan officers, mortgage brokers don’t work for banks. They operate independently and must be licensed. They charge a fee for their service, which is either paid by you, the borrower or the lender. The fee is a small percentage of the loan amount, generally between 1% and 2%.

If you pay this fee, the dollar amount can either be added into the loan or paid up front.

Loan brokers must disclose all fees up front and can only charge that disclosed fee amount. Each fee should be itemized and the broker should be ready to tell you exactly what each fee was for. Fee costs can vary depending on the size or number of loans.

Here are some ways mortgage brokers cannot get paid:

They cannot charge you hidden fees.

They cannot tie their pay to your loan’s interest rate.

They cannot get paid for steering you in the direction of an affiliated business, such as a title company.

In general, they cannot be paid by both you and the lender.

Unless you paid upfront costs, mortgage brokers generally do not receive payment unless the deal is closed.

Q$Q$Q
Mortgage Brokers: How many loan officers are in the USA?
A$A$A
In late July, the National Mortgage Licensing System (NMLS) released its first quarter report for 2013:

Federal Registration of Mortgage Loan Originators (MLOs)

At the end of the first quarter of 2013, more than 10,500 federally chartered or insured depositories were active in mortgage originations, with more than 394,000 MLOs registered. This is an increase of more than 15,000 MLOs (or four percent) since Quarter I 2012.

The data reveal that the majority of institutions employ 10 or fewer MLOs (71 percent) and operate in just one or two states (97 percent). Yet the top five institutions operate across the country and employ more than 136,000 mortgage loan originators, making up more than one third of all registered MLOs.

Page on Nationwidelicensingsystem (PDF)

In 2006, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics:

Loan officers held about 373,000 jobs in 2006. About 9 out of 10 loan officers were employed by commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, and related financial institutions.

Loan Officers - What do Loan Officers do? - Page 2

While the figures above seem to reflect that there are more MLOs now than during one of the peak years of the last U.S. housing bonanza, it pays to read the answer by Jillayne Schlicke for clarification. It is the best I've ever read on this topic and is required reading for those interested in mortgage compliance issues.
A$A$A
This is impossible to know but we could take some educated guesses.

At the peak of the bubble, the Nat'l Assoc of Mortgage Brokers was very proud to tell the world that "51% of all mortgage loans in America are originated by a mortgage broker."  They meant a loan originator who worked under a licensed mortgage broker.

At the peak, 2005-2007, the mortgage industry was drunk and high on predatory lending. Mortgage fraud was running rampant and regulators at the state level were starting to crack down.  Loan originators who worked at a mortgage broker were required to pass a competency exam and some states required a minimum level of pre-licensing education and a background check.  But this was ONLY for loan originators who worked under a mortgage brokerage.  So we could probably find or estimate the number of LOs in each state licensed at  that time....but again, this was only LOs working under a mortgage broker.

Loan originators worked at non-depository lenders, too.  A non-depository lender is a company that funds mortgage loans but they do not offer checking and savings like a depository bank.  Very few states required the licensing of loan originators who worked at non-depository lenders during the housing bubble. In fact, LOs who could not pass the test or who may have had a felony conviction and were not eligible for licensing at a mortgage broker shop could get hired at a non-depository lender when the licensing rules got tougher. So we do not have numbers for this group at the top of the bubble.

Loan originators also worked at depository banks, credit unions, savings and loans, etc., We don't have any data for the number of LOs who worked at these institutions at the height of the housing bubble, either.

In 2008 Congress passed the SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act which was part of the Bill that gave us the TARP Funds and ensured a government bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  The SAFE Act requires:

All loan originators who work at a  mortgage broker or non-depository lender take a 20 Hour Pre-licensing class, pass a national competency exam, take annual continuing education classes, pass an FBI background check, have no felony convictions at all during the past 7 years and no felony conviction such as a financial crime against a vulnerable adult at any point in a person's life. 

In addition, all loan originators who work at a depository bank must register with the NMLS and pass the background check and (when Dodd Frank rule-making is final) will have to take equivalent pre and continuing education.

The SAFE Mortgage Licensing Act has helped to raise the bar yet more work needs to be done. But I will save that for a future Q&A. 

Any consumer can search for a loan originator to confirm the status of a loan originator's license here:

http://www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org/

The NMLS issues reports to its regulator (The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) on a regular basis. In those reports are the number of LOs licensed or registered in all 50 states.  Contact them direct and I'm sure they'll be able to send you the most recent report.

http://mortgage.nationwidelicens...

That will give you the number of LOs currently licensed or registered today but it won't give you the number at the top of the bubble.

For example all I have for my home state of Washington State is the number of LOs licensed ONLY at mortgage broker companies at the top of the bubble:  14,000.  Currently we are at 4,000 LOs licensed at mortgage brokers AND non-depository lenders so we could say that we lost 10,000 LOs between 2007 and 2011.

What you could do, if this is a technical research project, is you could call each state's non-bank regulator and ask them for their LO numbers at the top of the bubble. All states that licensed mortgage broker-LOs have those numbers. Why? Because it was both fascinating and horrifying at the same time, to systematically watch those numbers drop as the great meltdown ensued like a giant, slow moving train wreck.

Let me know if you need a link to a page that would show each state's non-bank regulator and I will find a link for you.

Unless the mortgage company is FDIC chartered? anyone even quoting an interest rate on a home loan must be either in compliance with one or other as shown below:

In California, you are either working under/in compliance with :

The BRE / bureau of real estate (must park your real estate license with Broker you are employed with

The DBO/ department of business oversight. Must hang your NMLS license with the lender/bank/broker you are employed with.

So, if you are really that curious? I suppose you could do some serious digging? there will be many, and (technically speaking) there are still bad boys and girls out there who are cheating and did not get either license as mentioned above. Not cool or fair to those of us who paid (monetarily and time) to get the proper certifications/licenses, and of course to the consumer.

Q$Q$Q
What is the difference between mortgage banker, mortgage broker and a mortgage banker/broker?
A$A$A
A mortgage banker is a mortgage company, licensed as a mortgage banker, who will fund / originate loans in their own name. They may or may not service the loans they fund / originate. Typically most states will license mortgage bankers to service loans that they purchase from others. A mortgage banker, because they fund their loans with their own funds either from investors or a warehouse line of credit or some other credit facility, do not have to disclose certain aspect of loan origination income i.e. Yield Spread Premium. Most mortgage bankers do not hold their loans they originate. Due to expense, capital requirements etc, they will sell their loans to banks or directly to Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae (FHA / VA) or other Seller / Servicer. Their mortgage loan originators must be licensed under NMLS. Most mortgage bankers have to shop aggregators, other mortgage lenders, GSE etc to sell their loans to. This is not much different than a mortgage broker who also has to be an intermediary for the ultimate servicer and the consumer.

A mortgage broker is a mortgage company as well, they are typically licensed as a mortgage broker under either a department of financial institutions or a department of real estate. A mortgage broker is a mortgage originator only. In most states mortgage brokers are prohibited from servicing mortgages or charging any fees related to mortgage servicing. A mortgage broker does not have their own money to fund a mortgage  loan so they must establish a relationship with a bank, mortgage banker or private investor who will underwrite their loan and fund it. The mortgage broker is paid origination related fees only. A mortgage broker is required to disclose the Yield Spread Premium (YSP) i.e. the profit or margin the mortgage banker is paying them for brokering the loan to them. There is this idea that mortgage brokers shop "hundreds" of lenders to find the best deal. While this may have been very true once upon a time prior to Dodd Frank, today, most mortgage brokers have established relationships with many fewer banks or mortgage bankers to send their loans to. A mortgage broker can become more sophisticated and obtain a warehouse line of credit and fund in their name and sell the loan in an actual sale. This is rare as a warehouse lender will require a substantially larger tangible net worth for the mortgage broker than most other mortgage brokers and can be prohibitive.

A mortgage banker/broker, I believe you asking is, what we call a baby banker / or mini correspondent. They may be licensed as either a mortgage broker or a mortgage banker, however they will appear to be a mortgage banker who is funding the loan in their name however the money will be coming from a directed warehouse line of credit and is funded in a process called table funding. In name it appears that the originator is a mortgage banker as their name will appear on the mortgage or deed of trust, but the money is funded directly from the mortgage banker and the loan will be immediately and simultaneously sold to the mortgage banker. Many mortgage brokers that cannot meet higher more restrictive qualifications for a full warehouse line will do this as it may make them more competitive in their space, as well as remove the requirement to disclose YSP.

In no way is this a complete list of differences but are the major ones as they relate to operations.
A$A$A
Both will help you get a home loan but the banker works for banks directly whereas independent mortgage agent are not directly under or hired by any bank but they have connections with different banks. They basically ensure that you receive the mortgage ideally suited to you. A mortgage broker represents the borrower more than the lender. His responsibility is to get the borrower the best deal possible, regardless of the institution. It is always good to hire mortgage broker than dealing directly with banker.
A$A$A
A mortgage banker has access only to those products that the parent company has, which is considerably less than a mortgage broker. The reason is that with so many RMLOs (what used to be called "Loan Officers") they won't take the risk of the buyback language in the brokered loan contracts.

A broker/banker is usually a solely owned firm with a warehouse line that can fund in their name or the lender's name. This gives you more products to help you get the loan you need. But the law allows mortgage bankers to "hide" their commission at closing.

A mortgage broker has as many products as he/she has wholesalers. They work for the financial interests of the client, have the most education and don't hide their commission.
A$A$A
A mortgage banker and a mortgage broker can both enable you to get a home credit. A mortgage banker works for a bank or comparable loaning establishment which really gives you the cash to the credit. A mortgage broker doesn't speak to one establishment, however works with many to look for a credit for a particular person. The banker is a direct lender. The broker is a middleman between you and the lender. You can hire commercial mortgage banker at SV Commercial Lending.

In the UK term a mortgage banker would work and recommend a banks mortgage products only.  A mortgage broker would work from a panel of banks signed up to a network which gives the mortgage broker a bigger selection to choose from for his clients so you could say it involves a bit more skill in selecting the correct product but this usually offers the client more savings over bank only products. The banks sometimes offer their products direct and via a network which can cause a problem called dual pricing. In other words the client can use the mortgage broker but then see the cost is cheaper direct and try to go direct to the bank cutting out the mortgage broker. When the banks want to gain new business when they have reduced business levels they then court the mortgage brokers for more business by offering higher fees for introducing their clients to their bank. Its a love hate relationship between the banks and the mortgage brokers. Mortgage Bankers tend not to be a skillful as a Mortgage Broker as they only recommend the banks products and so dont know the full market range of products.
A$A$A
Mortgage Banks Generally, when people in the industry refer to mortgage banks, they are often talking about large retail banks such as Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Chase, etc. What makes these companies mortgage banks is that they lend their own money for mortgage Mortgages. In other words, when you get a Mortgage at Bank of America, they are actually writing the check at the closing.

Mortgage Brokers are middlemen who put home buyers and mortgage banks together. In other words, mortgage brokers do not actually lend their own money, but coordinate obtaining funds for you among the many different mortgage banks. Most mortgage brokers are small Mom & Pop business that is usually not known outside of their local markets. However, there has been a lot of consolidation in the industry and there are some large brokerages that are gaining in brand recognition.
A$A$A
This answer is for USA.

A mortgage banker, AKA lender lends you money directly and is limited to offering you the rates or products they currently have.

A mortgage broker however does not lend their own money. They act as a middle man between the borrower (you) and the lender (mortgage banker). The broker will work with you to evaluate your home loan needs, then compare and contrast hundreds of home loan products from all the lenders they partnered up with. Mortgage brokers already have contacts and relationships in the banking industry that put them at a distinct advantage.

A mortgage banker/broker basically can sell you a certain product for example an FHA loan, but does not offer Reverse Mortgage, so they would broker it from a Reverse Mortgage lender they partnered up with.
A$A$A
A broker/banker can be quite a solely owned firm with a warehouse line that can fund inside their name or the lender's name. This provides you more products to assist you have the loan you need. But regulations allows mortgage bankers to "hide" their commission at closing.

In the US, a mortgage banker closes the loan in their own name. The mortgage broker closes in the name of the funding lender. There are also independent mortgage bankers which broker some specialty mortgage products.

Retail mortgage bankers working for commercial banks have only their in-house mortgage products to offer. Larger independent mortgage bankers can often under-cut the price or service or both of the retail commercial mortgage banker.
A$A$A
A mortgage banker and a mortgage broker can both help you get a home loan. A mortgage banker works for a bank or similar lending institution which actually provides you the money for the loan.

A mortgage broker doesn't represent one institution, but works with many to shop for a loan for a specific individual. The banker is a direct lender. The broker is a middleman between you and the lender.

What are the steps associated with starting a mortgage broker business?
A$A$A
In CA, you will need to first take a salesperson exam given by the DRE. The DRE License requires the individual who passes to find a company to designate an individual with a California Department of Real Estate (DRE) Individual Broker License as the Broker/Officer of the company unless that person continues on to take their Broker's exam (and pass) thereafter. In order to get an Individual DRE Broker License, a person must complete 60 hours of education, show proof of 2 years full-time mortgage experience, pass the DRE Broker Test, which is only offered in California, and then submit an application for the Individual DRE Broker License.  If however, you are a licensed attorney, you can supersede this step and act as a broker, but you will still have to register with the CA DRE.  Also, since a person can be the Broker/Officer for multiple companies, often companies that don’t have an Individual DRE Broker employed with their company, will contact someone that already holds the Individual DRE Broker License to be their Broker/Officer, and then pay them a monthly fee to act in this capacity. However, this can get expensive. This requirement is the most burdensome part of obtaining a DRE License, and is the reason most companies will consider one of the other two license types.

There are two different types of loan originator (LO) licenses in California. There is the DRE NMLS LO Endorsement issued by the Department of Real Estate, and there is the DOC LO License issued by the Department of Corporations. The DRE NMLS LO Endorsement is used by loan originators working for DRE companies. The DOC LO License is used by loan originators working for CFL or CRML companies.

The DRE NMLS LO Endorsement is much harder to get than the DOC LO License. The DRE NMLS LO Endorsement requires 3 tests, 60 hours of education, and 2 applications. The DOC LO License only requires 2 tests, 20 hours of education, and 1 application. The reason for this difference is that the DRE requires a loan originator to first hold a DRE Individual Salesperson License or Individual Broker License before they can complete the NMLS requirements. To get a DRE Individual Salesperson License, a person needs to complete 40 hours of education, take the Salesperson test that is only offered in California, and submit an application for a DRE Individual Salesperson License. Then the DRE requires the DRE Salesperson to apply for the DRE NMLS LO Endorsement, which requires 2 more tests, 20 more hours of education, and a separate application. The portions through the NMLS for DRE and DOC are virtually identical, but again, the DRE requires the person to hold a DRE Individual Salesperson or Broker License before they can apply for the NMLS Endorsement, making the DRE LO Licensing requirements much more difficult.

The final step is to determine which kind of mortgage business you will want to speicalize in and then obtain the right corporate licenses thereafter. The CRML License is the only license type that allows a company to sub-service residential mortgages, which means to service loans that are owned by another company. The CFL License and DRE License both allow a company to originate commercial mortgage loans. The CFL License is the only license that allows a company to originate non-secured commercial or personal loans which can include car loans, personal lines of credit, and private lending.

The CFL License has a major restriction that needs to be pointed out. The CFL License only allows CFL brokers to broker mortgage loans to a CFL Lender. This means that a CFL broker can’t broker to DRE companies, CRML companies, or federally or state chartered banks, unless those companies also hold a CFL License. However, there is no restriction regarding what companies a CFL lender can sell loans to. The restriction solely applies to brokering loans.

Minimum Net Worth

Net Worth is the company’s assets minus the company’s liabilities. Each license type has different minimum net worth required for approval.

The DRE License has no minimum net worth requirement. The CRML License has a $250,000 minimum net worth requirement. The CFL License has a $250,000 minimum net worth requirement if the company is originating residential mortgage loans. If the company is only originating commercial mortgage loans and non-secured loans, then the minimum net worth for the CFL License is only $25,000.

If you need more information on which lenders to align your newly formed mortgage business with, go to www.scotsmansguide.com and look up the matrixes for every lender you would like to either set up correpsondent lending or TPO relationships with.  You will need to request packages from each and the requirement to start originating will require all the licenses and net worth requirements above.  Best of luck to you!

Get preapproval for your mortgage. Pre-approved for a mortgage means that the mortgage agent has studied all your credit and financial history and has sanctioned to provide you mortgage. Securing a pre-approval increases the chances of being granted a loan. Shopping around with lenders for a home before getting preapproved for a mortgage is equal to walking in a shopping mall without caring your wallet.

Since loans is available in different sizes, and interest rates, always compare rates of several mortgage agents. Comparison can help in determining which type and terms of loan is most suited for you, different loan payment options, and breakdown of several loan mortgage fees.

Simply research online for potential and best mortgage agents near mewhich provides knowledge and insight into a company’s terms and policies.

A mortgage broker gathers paperwork from a borrower and passes that paperwork along to a mortgage lender for underwriting and approval. The mortgage funds are lent in the name of the mortgage lender, and the mortgage broker collects an origination fee from the lender as compensation for services.
