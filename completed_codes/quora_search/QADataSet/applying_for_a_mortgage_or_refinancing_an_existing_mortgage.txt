Q$Q$Q
How much would my name being on an existing mortgage (my mom's house) affect the amount my wife and I would get approved for on a new mortgage?
A$A$A
It’s same as you having a mortgage and being fully liable for the amount.

If it’s a sizable chunk of your income, your lender is unlikely to give you a large loan due to existing commitment. They do not want you to default and if you are close to or at the recommended 30% of income on the existing mortgage, it would not be surprising if you could be denied additional funds.

Solutions are several:

paying off existing mortgage

get existing mortgage refinanced only in your mother’s name (not clear from the question whether this is a possibility)

have only your wife apply for mortgage (with her score/report and income, excluding you)

If it is not possible to remove your name from the mortgage and you absolutely must apply for a loan with your wife, you can only consider the nuclear option - of selling the property which will remove the obligation from your side.
A$A$A
Based on what you said it would not create an issue as the mortgage is the security instrument that states the mortgage company has a lien on the property. What you need to know is are you on the Note. The Note is the obligation to repay the mortgage and states the interest rate, payment, when the payment starts and when the term of the loan ends.

So being on the mortgage is easily explained for whatever reason your name is on the mortgage. Why? Did you homestead it as your primary home? Were you a co-borrower on the loan to buy the home? Do you currently live in the home or somewhere else and your Mom makes the payment? If you live in the home but she makes the full payment and you can show this with written documentation for at least the last 12 months and she has not been late ( more than 30 days ) — this assumes your on the Note— you might be able to have the monthly payment not counted in your debt to income ratio.

Would need a little more info to be more specific.
A$A$A
It all depends. If you are on the mortgage and contribute to the payment of the debt at all, you will have to qualify for the new mortgage with the other mortgage in your debt ratio. If you mother has made all the payments out of her own funds, and that can be verified for the past 12 months, there are lenders who offer programs that will allow that debt to be removed from your debt ratio.

Debt ratio is calculated as the total of all your installment and credit card payments and taxes and insurance on real estate owned divided by your gross income. How high that can be depends on the lender but can be limited to as low as 37% but some programs will go up to 57%. (FHA) Average is max of around 45%.
A$A$A
Depending on the amount of debt it could prevent you from obtaining a mortgage completely.

$x of income will qualify you for $Y of a mortgage. Assume ma’s mortgage is $z. If $z is greater then $Y forget it. Never going to happen. If $Y is greater then $Z they you could qualify for a mortgage of $Y-$Z.

The reason is that as a co-signer on a mortgage you are considered to be responsible for the entire debt.

What does refinancing mean?
A$A$A
Hi,

Refinancing is the process of swapping out loans, moving debt to a different loan or lender. The process is briefly described below:

You’ve got an existing loan

You apply for a new loan

The new loan pays off the existing loan

You’re now left with the new loan

Refinancing is the replacement of existing debt with new debt. Typically, the purpose of refinancing is to replace high interest rate debt with lower interest rate debt. For instance, someone might owe $200,000 at a 5.0% interest rate and seek to refinance at new lower rates available from banks. If the current rate available to this person is 4.0%, they would save 1.0% on financing fees.

Interest rates change over time. A 5.0% rate 10 years ago in 2007 might have been a great interest rate at the time. Currently, lower rates are available than 5.0% so it can make financial sense to refinance even if you have to incur some closing costs to do it.

Refinancing can apply to car loans, home loans, student loans, commercial loans, etc.

Q$Q$Q
How can I buyout my spouse and keep the existing home mortgage?
A$A$A
The simplest answer is yes. You would give your spouse some agreed-upon sum of money in exchange for a grant deed transferring his interest in the property to you. Doing this, however, would not remove his name from the mortgage—he would still be technically obligated. The most common means of removing someone from a mortgage obligation is for the person retaining the property to refinance in his or her own name and, if necessary, use the funds to buy out the other owner.

From a practical standpoint, it is not a terrible thing to have the departing spouse on the mortgage. Although it will show up on a credit report, the debt can be excluded from consideration if he or she applied for new financing by providing evidence that someone else has made the payments for at least 12 months.

If the existing lender is willing, it is possible to rewrite the existing mortgage. This is called a “novation.” I believe they are relatively uncommon, as refinancing is somewhat easy. A novation agreement would involve the lender’s qualifying you for the existing mortgage just as they would if you were getting a new mortgage.

Hope this helps. Good luck.
A$A$A
In the USA, you can get the mortgage RECAST into your name, only. This means you must qualify to assume the mortgage without the income from your spouse. A recast is quite inexpensive, relatively speaking. This will keep the existing mortgage intact.

As to the other part of your question, you will need to bring cash funds or an acceptable equivalent to purchase your spouses interest.
A$A$A
If I recall, a good old quitclaim deed always used to solve everything. it's mostly used for clearing title issues, but it's a cheap easy way to transfer ownership, or get the other party off the deed.

That being said, If it's a nasty divorce, definitely push the quitclaim, because I think the grantor is still liable for the mortgage payments with none of the ownership!

Either way, a good attorney should be able to work it out, probably should have gone to an attorney before quora… definitely before listening to me…
A$A$A
It depends on what you mean by “buyout” your spouse. You may be able to get your spouse to sign a quitclaim deed, which you record, making you the sole owner of the property. If your spouse wants money in exchange for this, and that is what you mean by buyout, then it's done all the time.

If you do this, your spouse will still be on the mortgage since you cannot “quitclaim” debt (if only)! The spouse may or may not agree to such a thing since it makes them responsible for a debt on a property they don't own. The mortgage will continue to be reported on their credit report until it's paid off, typically in a refinance.
A$A$A
The answer will depend on where you are and what the policies of the holder of your mortgage are. If your spouse is a cosigner of the mortgage, you will need to get that name removed. The people to ask this question of are the holders of your mortgage.

In the area where I live, it is possible for one person to sign over their interest in a house as part of a division of assets in a separation agreement. If you are in this type of situation, you should probably consult a lawyer.
A$A$A
Just offer her the money, go to the lawyer or a notary and get her signature on a paper. Done.
A$A$A
In Australia you can, and get the mortgage switched to just the single name.

Been there, done that :)

Q$Q$Q
Which banks or loan organizations offer the best loans to remodel a house in US?
A$A$A
It will depend on if the home needing the remodel is a primary home you are purchasing or refinancing, in which you can apply for the following

Construction loan- also called a bridge loan. This is not permanent financing for the home. This type of loan often is interest only. You'd be required to put down 20%.

FHA 203k - This loan does offer permanent financing, though I’d recommend refinancing out of this loan due to the higher interest rate along with the Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI).

FannieMae HomeStyle - is the conventional 203k knockoff. This loan is hard to find because it keeps being revamped or “improved”.

2nd Mortgage/Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) - use the existing equity in your home to complete repairs. If you have decent or favorable terms on an existing mortgage and you don't want to touch it, the HELOC is a great alternative. HELCO’s can be extended up to 100% of the homes value. This loans can be interest only or fixed rates.

If the home requiring repairs is an investment or 2nd home, all the options above that would apply with the exception of the 203k as FHA loans are for primary homes only.

Let me know if I can assist further.

What is a Mortgage Loan?

A Mortgage Loan is a money advance given by a bank against your property. The property could be your house, a piece of land or any other form of personal or commercial real estate in your name. This makes it a secured loan, which means the lender can forfeit your property if you fail to repay the loan. If you are buying property for the first time, you can use it as collateral to get a Mortgage Loan. This is also known as liens against property or claims on property.

If you want to know the difference between Mortgage and Collateral, you can check out this answer - Adhil Shetty's answer to What is the difference between collateral and mortgage?

For what can I use a Mortgage Loan?

A Mortgage Loan can be used to cater to a host of personal financial needs, but it is most commonly used to purchase property. A Mortgage Loan can also be used to buy commercial or industrial property. The biggest advantage of this loan is that you can continue using the mortgaged property while repaying the loan. Once the loan is paid in full you are returned complete ownership of your property.

This loan will help you out when you want to expand your business, buy a house, send your children abroad for higher studies or pay for an expensive medical treatment. It has you covered.

What kind of properties can I mortgage?

Almost all kind of real estate qualifies for a Mortgage Loan. You can mortgage the home you live in, or the one you have rented out. It could also be a piece of land in your name. Commercial and industrial property and property under construction can also be mortgaged.

How much loan can I get against my property?

Most banks loan a sum equivalent to 50%-60% of your property value. Some banks, if they sense good appreciation of your property, can raise the bar to 75%. Keep in mind, banks will reassess the value of your property from time to time.

What is the interest rate on a Mortgage Loan?

The interest rates on a Mortgage Loan commonly hover around 12% to 15%, making it one of the most affordable loan offerings. That’s why a lot of people prefer this over a Personal Loan, which generally comes with a higher rate of interest. In fact, Mortgage Loans are the second cheapest retail loans offered by banks after Home Loans. Generally, the maximum repayment tenure for Mortgage Loans is 15 years, but it can be more depending on the bank of your choice.

There are three ways to repay a Mortgage Loan:

Fixed Rate Mortgage (FRM) - FRM requires you to pay a uniform interest rate and principal amount.

Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) - Under ARM the interest rate changes throughout the repayment tenure, based on economic and market conditions.

Interest Only Mortgage Rate -  If you opt for Interest Only option, you will only have to repay the interest amount during the loan tenure and return the principal after that.

When you repay a loan, you return the principal amount with interest and within a time frame mutually agreed upon by you and the lender. Add property tax and insurance costs to the Mortgage Loan.

Why the insurance? The insurance safeguards your property against damages. Make sure you factor in all these components before calculating your EMI.

What is the eligibility requirement to get a Mortgage Loan?

To be eligible for a Mortgage Loan, you have to be salaried or a self-employed person and at least 21 years of age. Other than these two basic criteria the bank will also assess:

Total Annual Income

Income Tax Returns For The Last 3 Years

Total Work Experience

Experience With The Current Company

Property Value

Existing Loans/Liabilities, If Any

Total Number Of Dependents

Loan against property vs. Personal loan
A$A$A
A mortgage in the UK is simply defined as:

A monetary loan for purchasing property or land to inhabit.

The loan is held against your house or land until it can be paid off.

The specifics are a lot more indepth, including repayment plans and how to compare mortgage rates.

If you can’t afford to keep up with the payments your home WILL be repossessed by the lender.

I've covered What Is A Mortgage, which goes into A LOT more depth explaining.
A$A$A
Mortgage Loan :

A loan to finance the purchase of real estate, usually with specified payment periods and interest rates. The borrower (mortgagor) gives the lender (mortgagee) a lien on the property as collateral for the loan. The mortgagor lien on the property expires when the mortgage is paid off in full.

You Apply for Mortgage Loan for Usually Following Reasons / Functions:

Home Buying:

The primary function of a mortgage is to supply a home buyer with enough money to purchase a home, either by buying an existing house or having a new one built. Mortgages pay the seller or builder directly and set out a timetable for repayment that the borrower can afford. Once the mortgage is paid off through monthly payments, the homeowner owns the home outright. Even before paying off a mortgage, a homeowner can sell the home to another buyer and receive payment through the new buyer's use of a mortgage.

Home Improvements

Mortgages are also a major source of funds for home improvements. A home equity line of credit, which is a type of second mortgage, gives a homeowner the chance to make charges to a new account that is backed by the equity in the home. Home equity loans are similar, but deliver a one-time payment instead of a credit account. This new loan exists alongside the first mortgage and can pay for improvements that increase the value of a home prior to selling or make it a more comfortable place to live. Cash-out refinancing is another type of mortgage that replaces an existing mortgage and gives the homeowner a lump sum payment, which can finance home improvements.

Funding Other Expenses

The money a homeowner receives from a second mortgage or a cash-out refinancing plan can go to other uses besides home improvements. Paying for unforeseen medical expenses or sending a child to college are only two of the most common uses for the funds from a second mortgage.

Profit for Lenders

For banks and other lenders that offer mortgages to home buyers, the loans serve as a means of making a profit. Lenders charge interest on mortgages, which not only pays for servicing the account but also provides profit, mitigating the risk of lending such a large sum of money to even the most qualified borrowers. Individual investors and investment firms can buy mortgage-backed securities, which also earn profits from the interest that mortgage borrowers pay.

Hope that above information is useful for you. Read and enjoy.

Bruce's answer is correct.  In layman's terms:

You want to purchase a home, but you don't have enough money

If you have 20% of the amount required, the bank will lend you the other 80% and let you pay them back over a long period, like 20 years.

However, if you don't pay it back, then the bank gets to take the house away from you, because they have a lien (legal claim) registered on the house.

A mortgage loan is a secured type of loan. This loan is given by almost all banks and NBFCs across India. In this loan a borrower is supposed to keep his or her property as mortgage to the lender in order to get funds. The property is kept as mortgage to the lender until the loan is paid in full, with interest rate in the given tenure. If the borrower fails to pay off the loan, the lender sells the property to recover the loan money. Banks and NBFCs give mortgage loan for residential as well as commercial properties.

A Mortgage loan, also plainly called to as a mortgage, is used by buyers of real estate property to raise funds to buy real estate; or by existing property owners to increase funds for any intention while putting a lien on the property being mortgaged. The loan is "safe" on the borrower's assets. This means that a legal method is put in place which permits the lender to take possession of the property and sell the property  either through a procedure called foreclosure" or "repossession" to forfeit off the loan in the event that the borrower’s failure to pay back on the loan or otherwise fails to abide by its terms.

There are chiefly two types of mortgages - fixed rate mortgage and Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARM). With fixed rate mortgages, interest rates do not vary with time. Nevertheless in the case of adjustable rate mortgages, the interest rates are regulated at certain intervals. Mortgage loan rates to a great extent differ with state, lending firm, loan sum, value of the security, credit rating of the buyer and the type of the loan.

Mortgage loan rates are governed principally by the Federal Reserve Board. So, if the board varies the interest rates, the mortgage lenders should alter their interest rates accordingly. Mortgage loan rates are also influenced by many market and economic factors such as inflation. Normally, lower mortgage loan rates can be gained if you pay a down payment of 20% or more of the loan amount. Alternatively, if you pay a down payment of 5% or less of the loan amount, you may only qualify for a higher interest loan.

Generally, the mortgage loan rates fall wherever between 5% and 13%. Long term loans have vaguely elevated interest rates than short-term loans; usually the difference is below 1%. Loan rates also differ with mortgage loan forms such as commercial loans,FHA Loans, VA Home Loans, home equity loans, home improvement loans, and bad credit/sub prime mortgage loans. First mortgage loan rates are typically lesser than those of second mortgages.

Mortgage loan processing services can be quite stressful if not availed from a firm which does not offer comprehensive mortgage solutions. Hence it is vital to select the top player in the industry.

What Is A Mortgage?

A loan that is secured by property or real estate is called a mortgage. In exchange for funds received by the homebuyer to buy property or a home, a lender gets the promise of that buyer to pay back the funds within a certain time frame for a certain cost. The mortgage is legally binding and secures the note in giving the lender the right to have legal claim against the borrower’s home if the borrower defaults on the terms of the note. Basically, the borrower has possession of the property or the home, but the lender is the one who owns it until it is completely paid off.

Repaying A Mortgage: What Is Included?

The mortgage is usually to be paid back in the form of monthly payments that consist of interest and a principle. The principal is repayment of the original amount borrowed, which reduces the balance. The interest, on the other hand, is the cost of borrowing the principal amount for the past month.

A monthly mortgage payment includes taxes, insurance, interest, and the principal. Taxes are remitted to local governments as a percentage of the value of the property. These tax amounts can vary based on where the borrower lives and are usually reassessed on an annual basis. The insurance payments go toward mortgage and hazard insurance. The property mortgage insurance (PMI) protects the lender from loss incurred if a borrower defaults, whereas hazard insurance protects both the borrower and the lender from property losses. The funds may be held in escrow or the lender may collect the taxes and the insurance. PMI typically is not required if you put 20% or more down on your home. As long as you are not behind on payments, PMI payments are automatically terminated when either you are at the midway point of your loan in time, or when the loan-to-value (LTV) reaches 78%. You can request cancelation when you LTV reaches 80%.

Applying For A Mortgage: The Steps Involved

The process of applying for a mortgage loan can be a stressful. The first thing a borrower should do before going to their bank is acquire a copy of their credit report and check it for errors. If there is any incorrect information, it needs to be disputed as outstanding issues can cause a mortgage application to be rejected or lead lenders to charge a higher rate of interest.

A mortgage loan, also referred to as a mortgage, is used by purchasers of real property to raise money to buy the property to be purchased or by existing property owners to raise funds for any purpose. The loan is "secured" on the borrower's property. This means that a legal mechanism is put in place which allows the lender to take possession and sell the secured property ("foreclosure" or "repossession") to pay off the loan in the event that the borrower defaults on the loan or otherwise fails to abide by its terms. The word mortgage is derived from a "law French" term used by English lawyers in the Middle Ages meaning "death pledge", and refers to the pledge ending (dying) when either the obligation is fulfilled or the property is taken through foreclosure.[1]

Mortgage borrowers can be individuals mortgaging their home or they can be businesses mortgaging commercial property (for example, their own business premises, residential property let to tenants or an investment portfolio). The lender will typically be a financial institution, such as a bank, credit union or building society, depending on the country concerned, and the loan arrangements can be made either directly or indirectly through intermediaries. Features of mortgage loans such as the size of the loan, maturity of the loan, interest rate, method of paying off the loan, and other characteristics can vary considerably. The lender's rights over the secured property take priority over the borrower's other creditors which means that if the borrower becomes bankruptor insolvent, the other creditors will only be repaid the debts owed to them from a sale of the secured property if the mortgage lender is repaid in full first.

A loan secured by a mortgage.  A mortgage is a security instrument. It creates a lien on real property (e.g., a house, apartment, building, land, etc.). The real property serves as collateral for repayment of the loan. If you default on your obligations to the lender, the lender can foreclose the mortgage and obtain title to the real property. Then the lender can liquidate and use the proceeds to reduce (and perhaps eliminate) the debt.

Hello Suraj,

A mortgage loan is a secured loan. Money is lent against an asset of the borrower, usually a piece of land, apartment or another property. The lender holds a lien on the property. Incase of non-repayment of the borrowed funds the lender has the right to sell the underlying asset and recover their money.

Hope this answers your query

A Mortgage Loan is a money advance given by a bank against your property. The property could be your house, a piece of land or any other form of personal or commercial real estate in your name. This makes it a secured loan, which means the lender can forfeit your property if you fail to repay the loan. If you are buying property for the first time, you can use it as collateral to get a Mortgage Loan. This is also known as liens against property or claims on property.

A mortgage loan is a loan secured by means of real property through a mortgage note which evidences the existence of the loan and thus a charge is created on that property which secures the loan. Over the period of years, the borrower repays the loan along with the interest, until he/she eventually owns the property free and clear. Mortgages are also known as "claims on property". The loan is "secured" on the borrower's property. I found this information from article given at http://www.finmart.com/sr-mortga.... Hope it helps you further.

It’s a loan with your house and land used as collateral. If you don’t pay back the loan, the lender will foreclose. That doesn’t mean the bank owns the house until you pay it off. It means they’ve got a lien against the property. A lien is the right to take possession of someone else’s property, in this case your home, until a debt is paid off. So you really are a homeowner even if you have a mortgage. You just own a home with a lien.

Q$Q$Q
Why is my credit score below 800 (776) when I always pay on time and use a low portion of my credit? Why don’t I have a near-perfect credit score?
A$A$A
That’s a great question. I had a similar experience trying to get to an 800 credit score as well. I never understood why my score would always fluctuate despite me paying everything on time.

Like everyone says, 800 has just become an arbitrary milestone that a lot of people have tried to reach. But in reality, your score is good and there is most likely no true advantage of having an 800 compared to a 776.

To really understand what’s going on with your score, it’s important to understand the factors that affect it.

Payment History: Everyone likes a responsible person. One of the main things lenders check is your history of payments. Are you good at paying things back on time?

Credit Utilization: This is essentially how much you’re using out of the total amount of credit you have. If you have $10,000 total line of credit across 4 different credit cards and you’re carrying a balance of $3000, your utilization ratio is 30%. If this ratio is too high, it indicates a risk to lenders, as you don’t want to be too close to your credit limit. A good utilization ratio to keep is around the 30% mark.

Length of Credit History: Lenders like to see people with a long history of credit responsibility. Anyone can look like a good borrower if they just started a line of credit yesterday. If you open new accounts, that does affect this total, but note that the more accounts you have over time, the more stable this number becomes.

New Accounts: This ties a bit into the previous one, but opening a bunch of accounts all at the same time does affect your score.

Types of Account: This is a smaller factor, but lenders like to see you have a variety of different credit types. You can definitely build credit by just having one type, like a student loan. But if you also have a house mortgage, credit card, and car loan, lenders tend to take notice as well.

It seems like you’re on a very good track. You’re definitely knocking out the first two categories. A lot of times its the length of credit history that affects your score overall, if you’re newer to credit. And every time you open a new card, you’re affecting your average age of your accounts.

But if you excel in all these categories, you’ll definitely gradually build up credit. Sometimes it really just takes more time. If you want more information on this, check out this article.

First of all congratulations on getting a score of 776 which is great for most lenders. There are many factors that drive the score and each one of them have different affect on your score. A score more than 750 indicates good payment behavior and low credit utilization. Probably you are lacking on the credit mix part and have exposure to only one type of trade-line, or it can very well be a case of low account age. The following factors affect your score:

Payment History (35%)

Amount you owe (30%)

Account Age (15%)

New Accounts (10%)

Credit Mix (10%)

I advise to follow the following four fundamental rules to maintain/increase score (seems like you are following all of these):

Check your credit report

Setup Payment reminders

Reduce the amount of debt you owe

Chose the right credit Card

There have been some good answers to your question, most of them accurate. Here’s my take, from the point of view of a mortgage loan originator who works with credit reports and scoring every day.

First, as others have mentioned, your score is very, very good. There is no practical advantage—other than bragging rights—to a higher credit score. Form a mortgage lending standpoint, a FICO score of 740 or higher gets you the best rate. 760 gets the best rate of mortgage insurance for anyone who might require it.

There are several components to the FICO score. One of these, obviously, is performance on financial obligations—how many late payments a borrower might have, and how long ago they occurred. Once any late payment is two years old, it has far less effect on one’s score than a more recent event. At three to four years old, the effect on the score is essentially negligible. All late payments drop off after 7 years. Bankruptcies and foreclosures are gone in 10. (I realize these matters are not in your history, but I mention them for anyone else reading this)

Credit utilization is another important component. Once your balance for revolving accounts (credit cards) exceeds 30%, it starts to pull your score down. It is a very good idea to keep revolving accounts active, but not necessary to carry a balance. One famous self-described financial guru claimed that a FICO score is an “I-love-debt score.” This is utter hogwash. He also claims that “responsible use of a credit card does not exist.”

But I digress.

“Hard” inquiries to your credit file can have some effect if there are too many of them. A “hard” inquiry is one connected to an application for credit. If a creditor with whom you already have an account checks your credit as part of their regular maintenance process, your score will not be affected. Likewise, if you check your own credit, your score won’t be affected. These are called “soft” inquiries. When you apply for credit, like a car loan, and the creditor runs your credit and extends credit, your score won’t be affected in any meaningful way—but having a new “unseasoned” account will pull your score down a few points for 3–6 months before it recovers.

An account with a consumer lender, like a payday lender, can hurt your score, as will opening a number of new accounts in a short period of time.

The age of accounts is a positive factor. An American Express or Visa card that you’ve had for 10 or 20 years will add points to your score—possibly a lot. I have seen very few 850 credit scores in my career, and in every case, they have been from people who have had some of their accounts for 30 years or more. One of my clients, a gentleman in his 80s who was refinancing his small mortgage, had a score of 845. His wife’s was 850. He was outraged, and demanded to know who he should contact to fix this gross injustice. I think she just had one account in her own name that was decades old. All their other accounts were in both their names.

The bottom line is this: your credit score is just fine—exceptional, even. If you just keep doing what you’re doing, it will creep higher of its own accord.
A$A$A
A lot of the things you have listed as positive, are actually negatives when it comes to credit scores.

Utilization: You want an overall utilization of 1 - 9%, for maximum 'points' toward your credit score. Actively using all of your credit cards will also help, in the sense that the issuer may decrease your credit limit or close the account altogether due to non-usage. Both of which will hurt your score.

Diversity: Having outstanding auto/student/mortgage loans are actually a pro for your credit score - as long as they're not in delinquency.

All that being said, it's pretty hard to get a near-perfect credit score, and if you're not itching for loans, that doesn't really matter anyway.
A$A$A
Honestly, once your credit surpasses the “Very Good” Range, it’s not important to get your credit score to “Excellent”. You’ll still get the very best credit cards.

Credit Mix (ie having an installment loan) is dragging down your credit.

I would also guess that frequent credit inquiries hurts your score a bit too. I like FreeScore360 for some analysis specific to your situation. But be careful, you need to cancel your account before you get hit with the $39.95 monthly fee.
A$A$A
You said it "I do not have any sort of loan (car, mortgage, or student loan)".

In order to have a perfect score (even higher than what you already have), one needs to have a healthy operating history of revolving as well as installment loans.

You have healthy revolving debt (credit cards) but no installment loans (car, mortgage, or student loan).

Having said that - perfect score sounds better to the ears. In reality, there is hardly any difference between where you are and where perfection is. You will get the best interest rates even with 776.

I think you should be pleased with your current score, especially since score is not as important as trade history depth and breadth.

Appears while you have deep history on credit cards, you don’t have enough variety or breadth of credit with the same lengthy history. You are missing two of the majors, car loan or mortgages. I would never recommend someone go take out a mortgage to get an 800 in your case. I, however, have been known to finance a car loan from a bank or credit union that I can easily pay cash for just to build a relationship with that said institution.

I easily could have paid cash for each of these vehicles but I wanted the history which would aid me in my business endeavors and low rates across any expenses. After a solid down payment. I funded a bank account that was set up on automatic payments to pay down the loan over time.

Your personal financial plan may not require any changes to what you currently have earned over time. Just an option should you want to increase trade history variety.
A$A$A
First off, let's be honest...your score is "prime"...where you are is perfectly adequate to get the best Interest rates and loan terms for well north of 95% of credit decision situations (assuming the non-credit score related aspects of your application are adequate).

The credit scoring model follows a bell curve....it's a lot easier to move from 575 to 600 than it is from 775 to 800...and it's all but impossible to actually get above about 825.  But that's okay, this isn't an arcade where you need to get the High Score...you just need to model out well enough to get a loan if you need it.

When you get into exceptional score range, things that don't make much of a difference when you're down in the 600's start to be more important...so things like your "mix" of credit become a factor.  To max out that, you need to have multiple trade lines of long standing of all of the major trade lines (automotive credit, mortgage credit, credit card credit, personal loan credit, and other credit).  Just a bunch of credit cards won't do it, no matter how well you manage them.

That's the kind of thing that goes into exceptionally high scores.
A$A$A
I agree with the lot of the points below, and with your rating there shouldn’t be much scope for worrying. To build on the answers below, I can give a view of how you can use financial technology to get a better score.

Lenders are waking up to the use of digital data and how it can be used to assess you. Imagine you have 2 borrowers, both with exactly the same traditional input variables (payment history, address, etc). However, one has a network of friends which would be deemed to be uncreditworthy, whereas the other has a network of people who have always paid off their debt on time. Which one would you rather lend to?

There is a spring of new companies who offer this service to lenders. Basically they crunch the numbers on behalf of lender. What you have to do is allow them permission to your public data on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn etc. They then build a digital profile of you, and then cross-reference this web against 1000’s of databases, and kick out a number. You can then use this number with your lender to get a preferential rate.

There are plenty of these companies cropping up, but one of the main players is FriendlyScore. They are the quickest to use and have the best tech from what I’ve read, and their service is free to the borrower.
A$A$A
One reason could be that you are not showing to the credit agencies that you can handle credit - even though you maybe can. If you borrowed a lot more and always paid back on time you would almost certainly increase your credit score. Also, you could take out a car loan or a mortgage and by being a good boy demonstrate that you are someone worth lending to and therefore deserve a higher credit score.

I think everyone, when they leave school, should be taught the important facts of financial life

Make sure you have a credit card.

Make sure that you use it, always abiding by the rule that you don’t buy anything using it that you could have paid for in cash at the time - i.e. you’re not using it as a source of credit.

Make sure you pay it off in full each month, and that you do this by setting up a direct debit. If something should go wrong with your circumstances (lose your job, say), you can always contact the card company and get them to take a smaller amount (which will, of course, result in an interest charge), but make sure you pay at least the minimum.

If you rely on paying by cheque each month, one day you’ll forget, and bingo! you’re on the bad boys list - just what you don’t want!
A$A$A
Is that your Vantage score, FICO, or another one? This is about what my FICO score (765) is. And, I use my cards similar to how you do. Now my Vantage score 3.0, is almost 800. My girlfriend has similar credit usage and her Vantage score is like 820. We make a similar six figure income.

So why are our Vantage scores different? Her credit history is quite a bit longer than mine.

I had her put my name on one of her cards that she's had for almost 20 years. This caused my credit report to also reflect 20 years of credit history. Yes, when someone does this, you basically get that entire history pulled into your report. This helped me raise my score a few points. And. It put my average opened credit years over 5, with the longest opened account being 20. It helped but not a great deal.

Still, you've got a good score. And, you're probably able to get some of the best rates available with that.
A$A$A
Because those are not the only factors in the score.

Other stuff include average age of accounts, number of accounts, number of recent inquiries.

In any case, there isn't any practical difference between your score and a perfect score, as you can see by being approved for the offers.  You would probably have to go down below 720 to see any real differences.
A$A$A
I have a FICO score of 838 (down from 850 a couple of months ago because of a large purchase.)  This is only to illustrate how the score got that high. I also pay off my credit cards monthly, but I have an aggregate credit limit of almost $200,000  on my credit cards.  My oldest credit card is from 1967.  I have not taken out a new credit card in 5 years, so no hard credit inquiries on file.  I have a mortgage (and have had mortgages since 1968; no late payments.)  The mortgage is less than 30% of the value of the house. I have had car loans, always paid off early.  I have a HELOC for $100,000, with nothing outstanding on it. 

In short, it takes time, patience, and a rigorous attention to all financial accounts.  I have never had a late payment on an account in over 50 years.  I use on-line banking to check my accounts' transactions, balances, and set up alerts for payments due, low balances in deposit accounts, and unusual credit card transactions (found one fraudulent transaction and notified the bank that day, as well as the three credit unions.)

In closing, as other responders have said, once your credit score is above about 725,  there is very little difference in the effect.  The nice part is getting no-fee offers for financial services;  but, on the way to qualifying for a high credit score, one's financial life usually has already been put in pretty good order, so there's no need for the offers.
A$A$A
Honestly, who cares? You’re never going to be turned down for anything based on your 776 credit score, and you’ll always get the best rate on offers.

But if you’re really worried about it (and you should not be), don’t open any more cards. That can actually hurt your credit, because they count as new for a fairly long period of time. New debt lowers your score, even without a balance.

There are websites that will let you pull your credit to check it out, and give you tips on how to improve it. Credit Karma is the best known. If it is really important to you, you can plug your info in there, but know that while they don’t charge to show your score of history, they do make money advertising to you, so you’ll get added to a bunch of advertising lists.
A$A$A
To add to Erfu's answer, opening a lot of new cards makes your average credit age a shorter time. It's not based on your oldest account, it's based on an average of how old your accounts are. You might consider closing some of your cards that you no longer use because they are no longer interest free or whatever. A friend of mine opens a new one when the old one runs out of time on the interest free benefit and closes the first one.
A$A$A
I’m in a similar situation (score of 780), and it’s because I don’t “have enough” credit cards. I have two, one simply as a back up in case one gets compromised while I’m traveling. The algorithms appear to want me to have 4 to 5 credit cards.

Keep in mind a high credit score is designed to allow people to get more debt - for those of us who have no debt to get a really high score. Try using all your cards - without spending more, and see if the score goes up.
A$A$A
You say “lots” of credit cards; how many do you have? That may/may not have an impact on your credit rating. I think it’s better to have a variety of credit sources like loans/mortgages/revolving credit line as it shows your ability to pay off a variety of debt.

Credit inquiries from opening new credit cards (these hit surprisingly hard).

Number of new accounts opened in a short period of time (opening 1–2 in a year is better than 9–10).

How Many Credit Accounts Should You Have?
A$A$A
It could be for Lots of reasons. However Anything 760 or higher is excellent credit and you will not see any better rates with a 776 or an 800. If it was a 710 vs an 800 you would because a 710 is considered Good credit vs an 800 as excellent, however your score is still in the top tier class. So you will not see any rates being affected if you were needing to apply for any credit.

If you pay FICO the $20 to get your credit score, you can see exactly why you have a specific credit score and what you can do to improve. The free credit scores are not always the same as the FICO score.

If you apply for many credit cards, this will show as a hard check that will reduce your credit score.
A$A$A
If you are constantly opening and closing accounts, you are racking up hard inquiries on your credit report. These can have an adverse effect on your credit score. New cards also cause the average age of your credit suffer, another ding. Types of credit also need to be varied to raise your score. Credit cards, auto loans, installment sales contracts and mortgages, are the main types.

What is the process and experience like to refinancing a mortgage?
A$A$A
The basic concept of refinancing is taking out a brand new loan to clear off the existing loan or loans. So if you have one or more than one loan and are taking on another loan to get rid of the existing loan/s, you are actually refinancing your mortgage.

However, the process is the same as when you got your original mortgage/s. Some of the important steps to follow when refinancing a mortgage are: looking at your finances, checking your credit, applying for a mortgage, and preparing for closing.
A$A$A
I take it that you wish to move the mortgage from one lender to the other. The process is to

1. Get the loan snaction by another lender informing that the property is already under mortage.

2. After sanction, get a pre termination amount from your existing lender addressed to your new lender promising that on payment they would relase the title deeds to the new lender.

3. Submit the above to your new lender who would relase the amount to the existing lender and then collect the doc.

Q$Q$Q
Can one get a mortgage refinance with a low credit score?
A$A$A
The good news is that it is possible to  refinance a mortgage with a low credit score. The bad news is that low credit  scores means higher interest rates and fees.

Here are a few examples of mortgage loan  programs that have low (or no) credit score requirements:

HARP 2.0 Mortgage Loan (Must be a  Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loan eligible for the HARP program). No credit score  requirement.

FHA Refinance Loan. Low credit  score requirement, 580 FICO score.

FHA Streamline Refinance (Must be  a FHA loan eligible for the program). No credit score requirement.

VA Streamline Refinance (Must be a  VA loan with a VA eligibility certification).

Although the programs have low or minimum  credit score requirements, lenders have their own, often stricter underwriting  requirements (called overlays). You need to shop around for the right lender and  the best rate available, given your situation.

Remember, credit scores are only one  factor in determining your credit worthiness. Bad credit also means having a  high DTI (debt to income ratio), negative activity on your credit report  (collection items, bankruptcies and foreclosures are very problematic). Some  people have low credit score because of a lack of activity, while most have a  low credit due to late payments, defaults, etc. Monitor your credit report and  learn how to improve your financial position.

I recommend that you read an article I  wrote for Bills.com http://www.bills.com/refinance-w... ).  You will find more information  about the different loan products and tips on how to build your credit.

Yes. Credit is just one component of the lending equation and a "credit score" is just one component of a comprehensive consumer credit report. If you have sufficient equity in the home, stable long-term employment, other liquid or non-liquid assets and/or other favorable circumstances, you should still be able to refinance, however you will probably not receive optimal rates or terms with a low credit score.
A$A$A
Depends on how low. If you are lower than 620, it would be really, really tough. In today's mortgage environment, it would be ideal to have a 720+.

Q$Q$Q
If the VA loan limit in my county is less than the total amount I need, am I able to use a second loan to get a mortgage?
A$A$A
The VA county loan limit is for zero down VA loans. You can obtain a higher loan amount than the VA county loan limit but will be required to have a down payment of 25% of the difference between the purchase price and the VA county loan limit.  For example, if you purchased a home for $600,000, and your county VA loan limit was $500,000, your required loan limit would be 25% of the difference between the two. That down payment would be $25,000 and the max VA loan would be $575,000.

Another example: if the purchase price was $900,000 for the same county (with the $500,000 VA county limit). The difference between the puchase price and loan limit is $400,000. The required down pay,net would be $100,000 and the maximum loan would be $800,000.
A$A$A
I've never dealt with VA loans.

Yet, from purely financial perspective, you can certainly try to apply for another loan.

Be mindful though of the heightened requirements for the loan guarantee and for the payment assurance, such as higher incomes, stability of employment, and your credit history.

I do not know whether or not your service will be held against you - if you are in the active combat zone, there will certainly be a reservation as to your well-being if you are the sole income provider, and bank wants its money back no matter what.

So, the only way to test this is for you to say that you need to take out another loan - hopefully from the same bank as the original loan, otherwise the financial institutions will be quarreling as to who gets paid first in case, you know, things don't go as planned (yes, highly optimistic).

You may also be a subject to a higher interest rate, and may be required to maintain a certain balance with the bank, again, you know, for assurance purposes.

(This is all assuming that you are able to get a loan on your own, without a co-signer; latter can complicate things).
A$A$A
You have not specified the amount that you need. A VA loan provides for the veterans, active military personnel, national guards, or their surviving spouses. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers a guaranty to the eligible persons for a zero down payment home loan along a long-term mortgage facility. So if you are an eligible person to get VA loan, can easily apply it for streamline refinancing to pay the existing mortgage.
