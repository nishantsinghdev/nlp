Q$Q$Q
A loan collection agent took arguments personally and gave life threats. I have a recorded conversation. What should I do?
A$A$A
Approach the police and file a FIR
A$A$A
You did very well.

Tell him you will go to police if he does not stop bothering you.

Write a mail or a registered letter to the bsnk/ agency who sent him stating his criminal activity and stating that the bank/ agency is a Co perpetrator of the crime. Mail a copy to a friend to create a witness

Try to negotiate repayment of loan. The agency will be ready to settle it for a lower amount. Negotiations offer should be verbal and not in writing

Q$Q$Q
In the USA, what are some "underhanded" ways that state student loan collection agencies (SSLCA) attempt to harass and intimidate student loan debtors (SLD)? What techniques does the SSLCA use to try and arrest, jail, and imprison an SLD?
A$A$A
We don't have debtors prison in the US, so you can't be arrested, jailed or imprisoned for a debt. You can be sued, your paycheck could likely be garnished and fines leeved, but no jail.

Q$Q$Q
Has any US mother ever called the police on her adult son while he was attending law school because the mother did not like a letter the son wrote to a state student loan collection agency?
A$A$A
What?

This is extremely specific, so I will go with “I think it has happened once, recently.” and can only assume that the police talked to the poor confused mother and tried to explain to her that they should only be contacted when a crime has been comitted.
A$A$A
If the son sent the letter to a collection agency, how would his mother see it? It would have gone from his hands to postal employees to the addressee, a collection agency. Consequently, I’m going to have to say “no.”

People call police about all kinds of crazy things, like not enough french fries in a drive-thru order, so someone calling police about an imagined letter wouldn’t greatly surprise me. Perhaps the adult son imagined that the mother called the police about a letter he wrote. Police are used to calls from people under the influence of one kind or another or suffering from psychotic illnesses.

Now, if he threatened to do violence against employees of an enterprise, and his mother saw a copy of such a letter and knew that he had the means to carry out such a threat, then she should have alerted law enforcement. However, it’s far more likely, even in that situation, that the recipient of the letter notified authorities of his threat.
A$A$A
No.

That is insane, sad.

Q$Q$Q
I have a $20k charged off loan in collection. If I start making regular payments, can I have the balance moved out of collections on my credit report?
A$A$A
No, the charge-off from the original creditor will show on your credit report for 7 years. (You might be able to get the charge-off changed to just account closed. This usually takes professional help.)

No, you cannot have the collection account removed from your report. (Unless you can somehow claim the account is fraudulent or invalidated. This also takes professional help.)

A couple of solutions to getting out of collections:

Find a person or a lender who would loan you the $20k to payoff the debt. You will then start building a positive credit by paying on the new loan.

Buy your debt, for only pennies on the dollar, from the agency that currently owns it. This can be done by posting an offer to purchase your debt online through a personal debt purchasing aggregator like Buy Your Debts There isn’t a guarantee that the agency will sell it for less than the full amount owed, or if you can come up with that payment.

The financial industry is changing and your credit report will not hold as much power over your finances. With new online platforms like Ubankly, which completely does away with credit reports and fico scores, you will not be judged by a negative credit history.

There are new ways to incorporate other social factors into determining your credit-worthiness. There are crowd-funding and peer-to-peer lending sites that provide alternative ways you can get a loan to pay off your debt.

Hang in there and your financial health will improve.
A$A$A
No.

By making payments, you will validate that this loan is alive and correct for the collections agency.

The original company whom you had a loan with already reported it as collections/charge-off and you will not change that entry.

Even if you call that original company and ask to pay them, they will not be able to help you - the loan has been sold to a new company, and now this new company has all the rights to seek a payment from you.

If you can negotiate that this new collections company will make that adjustment (which they can’t do, by the way) and get this confirmation in writing from them, then you can start making payments.

Otherwise, your credit report has already taken a hit and you can’t undo it.
