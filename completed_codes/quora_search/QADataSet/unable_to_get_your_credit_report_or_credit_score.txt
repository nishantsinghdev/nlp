Q$Q$Q
My cibil report shows "we are unable to generate cibil score for you" how can I get a credit card now?
A$A$A
If your CIBIL is not generated so you can apply for ICICI or HDFC Credit Card because if your CIBIL is not generated so they Bank can provide you credit card.
A$A$A
Make a fixed deposit with a Bank and avail a credit card ( upto 75% of your deposit amount) against that. Make an instalment purchase of any item having 6 instalment tenure. Pay the instalments through this credit card. In 3 months your credit history will be generated and you can apply for a regular credit card. Your present situation is caused due to absence of any credit history.
A$A$A
This means you are a NA or NH customer. In this case, would advise you to apply for secured credit card by opening a fixed deposit make payments on a regular basis and build a credit history for at least 6 months. After that you apply for an unsecured credit card in the same bank.

Q$Q$Q
Why can't I get my credit score? I've never had a credit history but have recently got a secured credit card. Every time I go to sites to find my credit score, it always says it can't process my information. Is there a glitch in the system?
A$A$A
If you just received your SSN 5 months ago, the problem is likely that you do not have enough established credit history to generate a credit score.  Credit scores are generated by a credit scoring model which is just an algorithm that analyzes the prior credit payment history appearing on your credit report.  All credit scoring models have a minimum requirement for credit history ranging from a few months to as much as 6 months payment history. 

Credit reports typically only reflect payment history for a credit lines or loans.  Payment history on bills, such as mobile phones, utilities or rent, typically do not appear credit reports and thus do not help with credit scores.  Without a credit payment history to analyze, the credit scoring model will return a code that means that you don't have sufficient credit history to generate a score. 

If you do have at least one open credit line or loan, another potential issue is that banks do not always immediately start reporting to the credit bureaus.  Newly opened accounts can take up to several months to appear on your credit report. 

Also, be aware that there are 3 credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion and Equifax.  It is possible that if you only have one credit account, it may not necessarily report to all three credit bureaus and thus might not appear on the bureau from which you are trying to get your credit score. There is no requirement that banks report to any or all credit bureaus. 

In your case, if you believe that you have at least some established credit history, it might be worthwhile to get a copy of your credit report for free from Annual Credit Report.com - Home Page.  That way, you can see exactly what the credit bureaus are working with to generate a score.  If you are unable to pull your report, it is likely that the bureaus don't have any record of any credit accounts and thus you effectively don't have a credit report... or a score.
A$A$A
This happened to me at Experian, I would recommend mailing for your credit report. This is the Mail form to request your annual credit report.

Basically, the credit bureaus have extremely “thick” security. They don’t want to release your credit to the wrong person. This results in them not showing you your own credit either.

You might actually have better luck accessing your credit report through Credit Karma or Quizzle in the mean time.
A$A$A
Have you checked again lately?

A period of time must pass before the purchase and payment history on a first card is sufficient to generate a credit score, such as a FICO Score.

Even if they can't generate a score. there should at least be a credit report (the data that the credit score is calculated from) that has a monthly rating of your use of that card.

If the card does not show up on the credit report, it will never help you get a credit score. Not all secured cards are reported to the credit bureaus in a way that can build a credit score.

And remember to check the report and score from all 3 credit bureaus -- Experian, Equifax and Transunion. If it doesn't show up on one, it may on the others. Good luck!
A$A$A
Your question appears to assume that the credit bureau already has your identifying information. It does not, not until you apply for credit. The only information it possesses is what was submitted by creditors, plus certain public sources. The Social Security Administration does not give out your SSN, name or address to the credit bureaus.

Until you apply for credit, your credit file does not exist and you cannot be authenticated. To build a credit record, apply for a secured credit card. Use it, but keep the balance low compared to the credit limit and never miss a payment.
A$A$A
Credit score is something which you will build.

In your case, I assume you didn't have enough credit history with your credit file.

When you don't have enough credit history, Credit score can't be calculated from you thin file.

Wait for few more months to get it updated. try using credit cards and build your score.

Thanks,

Naresh
A$A$A
When I got my first credit card, it took me 5–8 months before my FICO and CreditKarma score caught up. Everything about good credit is slow, so just be patient. In time your score will appear.
A$A$A
Tony is right on if you recently got your SSN then there is likely nothing to report. You might want to try obtaining a credit card first to establish some credit history, but without a SSN your likely a ghost to all the credit agencies.
A$A$A
No need to worry. Just use the card you have properly and you will build a credit score. FICO does not begin showing a score until you have surpassed 350. This you should do fairly soon, likely within two credit cycles. If you take the time you can review some of my other posts on Quora on how to properly use your credit to build an awesome credit score.

Success!
A$A$A
You won't have a credit score until you start using your credit card. It usually takes a few months of consistent usage for you to build enough history to have a credit score.
A$A$A
You have to have a credit history to have a credit score. which is an indication of whether your loans/cards are going to be paid back. Since you have no credit history, you have no credit score. Best guess is that in about six months you should have a credit score.
A$A$A
You may have to actually call the credit agency to get your report. If you use different names on bills or other credit history items, if you fail to pass the questions they ask online, then they give that answer to you. If you call them in person with your social security number, etc. then it should be able to be taken care of and whatever the problem is will be fixed so that the next time you apply for something online it should go through.
A$A$A
Judging by how anal you are about this, I predict you will have great credit

I'm LARRY CHIANG and I'm real. So email me if you'd like help. I quote from

The Book of American credit called FCRA (it's not a book - it's a law that's longer than a book. Everyone else on Quora just spins and spits credit's urban legends)

Enjoy having a great credit score!

Q$Q$Q
I have large credit card debt that I cannot pay, what happens if I don't pay?
A$A$A
I will have to assume that you are not in England and Wales, as I know Quora is largely and American operation, so your laws are different.

Firstly if you have just received the Statement, and cannot make even if the minimum payment, contact that Credit Card Company immediately and ask to speak to their Credit Control.  Ask them to suspend the card, and tell them that you are now facing difficulties in making payment and that you would like to come to a “deed of arrangement”.

Tell them that within 7 days you will provide them with a receipts and payments account, together with a Assets and Liabilities statement (balance sheet) and a list of debtors. Also known as a Statement of Affairs.

Find the balances of all the Creditors (the people you owe money to)  and list them line by line  on the left hand side of a piece of A4 paper and total them up.

On the other right hand side of the same sheet write down all the money that you have in bank accounts, savings accounts, stocks/Securities  . Total them up.

Take one from the other and that will give you your net position - hopefully you will have a surplus, no matter how small it is.

If it is a net positions i.e. you owe more than you have in savings then technically you are bankrupt.  The key is whether you can pay your debts to time, so you want to steer clear of litigation at this stage.

On another sheet of paper draw a vertical line down the middle, and on the right hand side, write down your general income, from work, any other sources of income, say benefits you may received, pensions etc.

On the left hand side, right down all your urgent and vital needs that would include:

Rent/Mortgage

Food

Power, including Water,  Gas & Electric

Local Government taxes

Any other priority creditors (people who you owe money to which are vital to your living).

Telecoms (not your TV)

Add those up and that gives your “essential outgoings which have to be paid.

Notify them by telephone that you have had a problem with money and that you would like their accounts to be placed on hold, and that you will copy them in with the Balance Sheet (also known as statement of affairs) and that you will send them a copy.

On the right and side of the page write down the money you receive in the form of wages and other sources of income mentioned above.

Total that block of figures, and write down at the bottom of the column next to the out goings.

Subtract the smaller from the larger and that will give you your disposable income or at worst shortfall that is created.

If there is a surplus all well and good since you know that you can pay your debts, but not necessarily on time, particularly if they all come in one got.

If you have a short fall in the income show that on the “Receipts and Payments account”; and how much the short fall is per month.

Divide that short fall between the number of Creditors that you have and that will give you the amount per Creditor that the short fall is against their requirement.  Bear in mind that this is an AVERAGE.

Photocopy that so that it each of your Creditors (people you owe money to) so that they can see your position and that you are being honest.  In this case honesty really is the best policy as the sooner you let your Creditors know that you have got problems the more likely they are to help you.

Make sure that you clear you Utilities and that they are paid up to date. These are what as know as “preferential Creditors”. They would include, water, electricity, fuel.

Next write down your food requirements, as they come under pre-preferential as well.

Total those up, and subtract them from the money that you have as a “gross income” and that will give you a balance of “disposable funds” to satisfy the debtors.

If you are not able to keep up the instalments, notify them as quickly possible that you are in difficulties and that you would like to make an offer of a reduced payment until you get yourself back on your feet.  Again, if you have been honest with you, they will accept a reasonable offer. Ask for an address to send your receipts and payments account (cash-flow), and details of the savings you have, but cannot reach quickly. Also remind them that you want to pay everyone something so not to try and snatch everything from you.

That will usually be forwarded to their specialist Customer Services and Credit Control operations who will look at what you can reasonably afford. They should acknowledge receipt of the documents and either contact you by telephone or in writing making a suggestion what they would accept from them.  If it is too much, (Which they should see from the Statement of Affairs and the receipts and payments account), then they should be able to reduce the instalment for say a period of three months to give you breathing space to get yourself a new job or extra income.

Ask the to Amorticise any interest that may be accruing (being charged) so the debt does not get any higher, and make an offer that you can afford, and can/will comply with.  Generally speaking, if you have been open with them, they will co-operate and help. Particularly the Utility Companies.

Make a general distribution plan so that everyone gets something. Obviously things like Utilities and food must come first, and again they should accept that.  They can all see that you are making and effort, that you have fallen on difficult times and that you are being honest with them.  99% of the time, providing the offer is sensible, if if US$10 per month, they will accept it.  They will probably ask that they review the situation in 3 months time.

Make sure that you get the agreements in writing, with a confirmation letter from each Creditor that they will not enforce unless you default (not pay), and put them in  a safe place.  The whole point of this is that if you find you can’t pay one month, just phone them straight up and tell them you can’t and why; tell them a date you will be able to get a payment to them.

Try not to break the agreement as you credibility will go down hill, the less co-operation you will get, and the more likely you are to receive a Summons to recover the debt. If you cant comply, as above, tell them immediately.

Generally speaking most Creditors will accept a nominal payment: to put it bluntly. it is better than nothing as far as they are concerned and is cheaper for both of you than going to Court.

I wish you every luck, and once you have had the telephone conversation with each Creditor make sure you get a name and confirm the agreement that you have made, and also get them to confirm that in writing to you as well.

Keep all of this in one file and make sure that you do pay to terms, albeit at a lower amount, and make sure you get a receipt for each payment you make and that is kept in the relevant file.

Stay calm, don’t get stroppy and if you get some youngster screaming at you to make payment, put the phone down, and redial the company and ask to speak to a senior manager.  Tell them that you have received a threatening call from the collections department, you are prepared to pay as soon as your money comes in, and if you get a further call of that nature then you will go to the Police for an Harassment Order.

If you have the equivalent of Trading Standards, report it to them, and copy your letter to the Managing Director of the company which has caused you problem.

Providing you comply with all Orders, and agreements, no one can touch you; but again you do need to be honest and accept that they are going to ask that you fill in forms to show your receipts and payment, although you have already done so.

I wish you every luck, and hope that you will either come in to some money soon or that you will get a job which will allow you to at least increase the instalments to those you owe money to.

I worked in the credit card collections industry for a few years so I am fairly familiar with the process.  Note that this only applies to the United States, I am unfamiliar with the laws in other jurisdictions.

The first thing that will happen is that your credit card(s) will become "late" and a late fee will be applied to each missed payment.

When you miss the first payment and you are 30 days behind, depending upon the credit card company, you may begin receiving calls from their internal collections department asking for you to pay the bill.  You will get a letter or notification stating that you are past due, and that a late fee has been applied to your account.

As you continue to miss payments, your account(s) will go further past due and will accrue further late fees.  Your missed payments will begin to be reported to the credit reporting agencies and negatively impact your credit score.  Depending on the policies of your credit card company, at some point your account will be closed and you will be unable to use the account in the future, even if you pay it back up to date.

Since you have a large amount of debt you can expect your credit card company (or companies) to begin more aggressive efforts to gt you to pay on the debt.  They may begin to offer you modified repayment terms, or even to settle the debt for a smaller amount.  These will negatively impact your credit score, but not to the extent if you keep missing payments.

Eventually, at about 180 - 210 days past due, your account will be charged off.  This means that the credit card company will write off your account as bad debt for tax purposes and generally they will cease their attempts to collect on the debt in house.  This event will also be reported to the credit reporting agencies, and will severely impact your credit score.

The credit card company (or companies) will then sell your account to a third party debt collection agency (in some cases, they may not sell the account but simply 'hire' a collection agency to try and collect on the debt).  Since your debt is high, these agencies will be highly motivated to collect on the debt.  They will contact you by mail and probably begin calling you.  They may try calling you at work, and may even attempt to contact your friends/relatives if they cannot get a hold of you.  They will also report the collections account to the credit reporting agencies, which, again, negatively impacts your score.

They will likely offer you repayment terms or settlement offers, much as your original creditor did.  As time passes, they may wind up giving up on your account and selling it to yet another debt collection agency, who will begin the process anew and may or may not use more aggressive collections efforts.

Since you have a large amount of debt there is a decent chance that at some point, these collections agencies - or perhaps even your original creditor, depending on the institution - will pursue legal means of recovering the debt, by suing you for the amount.  If they succeed at getting a judgment against you, they will be entitled to garnish your wages and, of course, this judgment will be recorded on your credit history.  Such an event is extremely damaging to your credit score.

If you manage to avoid paying and avoid getting a judgment against you for long enough, the statute of limitations will pass and they will no longer have the option of pursuing legal relief.  This does not mean they will stop attempting to collect, it only means they can no longer sue you. 

After 7 years, the initial charge-off will be removed from your credit record, but you will still have a lot of rebuilding to do.

In any event, whether you avoid paying until the debt is past the statute of limitations, OR you decide to pay your debt, there is a chance that you won't see the end of it.  Some collections agencies purchase "zombie debt", which is very old debt, in hopes of collecting on it.  Sometimes your account will remain in the system and they will attempt to collect on debt even if you have paid it off.  You may have to deal with unwanted and unwelcome attempts to collect on your debt for many years to come.

Bottom line is, if you have the ability to pay, do it.  If you do not, contact your bank to see if they are willing to work out an arrangement with you.  If at all possible, avoid having your account go past due or worse.  It is a pain you'll have to endure for many years if you do.
A$A$A
That’s a stressful situation to be in! When you;re carrying a large debt load and living paycheck to paycheck, paying off debt can be very tough. But you can’t give up so don’t consider the option of not paying! It’s an overwhelming situation and a common reaction is to ignore the debts but the only way to get out of it is to pay your bills and seek professional help. Don’t panic, develop a plan and stick to it till you’re free.

If you don’t pay your debt, you will receive numerous calls and letters from creditors which will become very bothersome and difficult to handle. Here’s what will happen if you don’t pay your debt:

Your credit will be impacted negatively seriously. Your score will drop.

Collectors will call you non-stop. Here’s some more info on dealing with collection agencies.

Your applications will be denied as you’ll be seen as a risky borrower.

In the off chance you are approved for future borrowing, you’ll be subject to high interest rates.

You may find it difficult getting a job as some employers do look into credit checks before hiring.

You can get sued unfortunately.

Whether you pay or not, the record will stay on your credit report for 7 years.
A$A$A
I’m sorry to hear about your situation, if you don’t pay your credit card bills then you will start to receive late payment letters and will receive lots of calls from your creditors chasing you for a payment.

You have a few options available.

If this is a short term problem, for example you are unemployed but hope to get a new job very soon then you could contact all your creditors and explain that are you now unemployed and have no money to pay at the moment and ask your creditors to put your accounts on hold for a couple of months until your circumstances improve.

They will usually want you to send them a financial statement showing any income and outgoings as this will show them that you have no money to offer them if you are unemployed etc.

If this is a long term situation, for example your hours have been reduced at work or you are on long term sick pay and you are now struggling to pay the minimum payments to your creditors then you could contact all your creditors and explain that your income is now less than before and you are struggling with the minimum payments.

They will want to see a financial statement showing how much you can now afford to pay each month and will want to see how much your total debt is and how much you are offering to the other creditors also. Every creditor will need to be offered a pro-rata payment as this will give you more of a chance of the creditors accepting your offer. For example the creditor you owe the most to will be offered the highest amount every month. Also ask your creditors to reduce or freeze your interest and charges to help you clear the debt outstanding.

There are also lots other debt solutions available where you maybe eligible to have some of all of the debt written off depending on your circumstances, it would be a good idea to speak to a debt advisor and ask for free debt advice. The debt advisor will be able to advise you on the best debt solution available to you to help you clear your debt where you live.

I have written a blog about when someone struggling with debt should ask for help, when should you speak to a debt advisor it also explains about the different debt solutions available for anyone in Ireland who is struggling with debt also.
A$A$A
It depends on your personal circumstances and how your credit company or bank deal with your situation.

Your best best is to negociate with your credit card company as early as you can before you default in your account.

You may have to deal with legal consecuences that may affect your credit rating for many years to come,

Certain employers will not hire you if you are heavily indebted.

Try to get another job to help you with the payments.

Please get professional help.
A$A$A
If the debt is over 2K, then it is very likely that they will sue you for the debt. It may take a while but they generally try to collect right up until just before your states statute of limitation for the debt arrives.

Q$Q$Q
Is there actually a way to get your credit score for free? How can I get it without signing up for a trial membership? Isn’t it legally my property?
A$A$A
Your credit report from each credit reporting agency is, by law, available to you once each year for free from Annual Credit Report.com, a site set up by the three largest credit reporting bureaus and specifically authorized by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Each of your credit reports consists of factual information reported by creditors with whom you have dealt. The report itself makes no value judgement, and is therefore simply a piece of data used by a potential credit offeror to make their own decision as to whether to extend you credit.

In order to make that process easier, a private company called Fair Isaac Corporation developed formulas that take as their input all the factual information and output a single numeric credit score that makes it easy for a lender to make decisions in underwriting credit. In fact, there are 28 different FICO® scores that can result in different numbers based on the type of credit being considered: mortgage, auto, credit cards, etc. The most recently released score formula is FICO® Score 9.

Because the score (as opposed to the report) is not a piece of factual information, but instead a calculation made by a private company for which the credit bureaus (and thus the lenders) pay, you have no legal right to see it. You will therefore need to either purchase it yourself from Fair Isaac (which will give you all of your scores from all of the major credit bureaus) or get it either from one of the bureaus or from a lender who is authorized to provide it to you.

Here is some information on credit scores from myfico.com:

FICO® Score 8 is the version of the base FICO® Score model most widely used by lenders. In addition to base FICO Scores, there are also industry-specific FICO Scores such as the FICO Auto Score and the FICO Bankcard Score. The FICO Scores made available on myFICO.com are calculated from versions of the base and industry-specific FICO Score models. Your lender or insurer may use a different FICO Score than the version you receive from myFICO, or another type of credit score altogether.

Base FICO® Scores range from 300 to 850. Industry-specific FICO Scores range from 250-900. A higher FICO Score represents a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower FICO Score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk. There are three different major consumer reporting agencies — Experian®, TransUnion® and Equifax® — that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit file. Your FICO Scores are based on the information in your credit file at the time they are requested. Your credit file information can change over time and can vary from agency to agency. As a result, your FICO Scores can vary depending on when they are calculated and at which agencies they are calculated.

FICO Score versions currently available on myFICO.com:
A$A$A
Yes. The easiest way is to simply ask someone who has access to get it for you.

Anyone with a “permissible purpose” under the Fair Credit Reporting Act can access consumer credit reports and scores.

As a leasing agent for landlords, I had access to the three major credit bureaus through a credit clearing house. I was able to pull a credit report on anyone at any time with just some basic information. I believe the cost was $3.95 per report, so it wasn’t free, but the cost was negligible.

Bank loan officers, car dealers, leasing agents, etc., all have easy access to consumer credit reports.

Credit reports are not the property of the person who is the subject of the report. The reports are the property of the credit bureau that collected and compiled the data, until sold or transferred to a person or company having a “permissible purpose,” which includes, among other things, the consent of the person who is the subject of the report.
A$A$A
No, it is not legally your property.  It is the property of the credit bureau.  You do have the right to check the contents of your credit (I would not use the link above but this one: www.annualcreditreport.com the free credit report one is a company selling subscriptions to your credit reports).  This link was created in response to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which was amended in 2003. 



Now as far as getting the score for free, often credit cards or banks have some account benefit that allows you to check it for free (sometimes the score only, sometimes the full report).  It doesn't seem to be a big selling point though, because I was unable to find a list of credit cards that offered this. 

I have noticed that many people worry too much about their credit score, and not enough about building the right habits that will allow them to improve their credit.  The score takes a long time to build and improve.  Focus on paying your bills on time, not carrying a balance on your credit cards and only apply for credit when you really need it and your score will improve.  If you're over 720, I wouldn't worry about it; you're probably as high as you need to be to get the best deal on almost everything. 

If you'd like more info, here's a link that gets a bit more in-depth. 

http://www.creditscore.net/how-c...
A$A$A
Yes, www.creditkarma.com is completely free! Other than that you can get free credit report from all three agencies free of cost once in a year from www.annualcreditreport.com.
A$A$A
Most of the answers here are wrong.

Notably you cannot get your FICO score from sites like Credit Karma, they offer other products you can use as indicators…but not the actual number.

The most straightforward way to getting your FICO score is directly from your credit card company. Most credit cards have a tool on your account page to provide you that number. Both my Visa and Discover cards offer this.

If you don’t have a credit card, you probably don’t have much for credit. You need to have credit and show you can use it in order to have a very favorable credit score. The term “credit score” is something of a misnomer, it should be called a “debt score” because it's more of an indication of how well you bear debt.

For an option to get your FICO score without a credit card account, Discover has actually opened up their FICO tool to non-account holders recently. That option can be found at Free Credit Score - FICO® Credit Score Card

There are two ways to get your credit score for free -- Credit Karma and Credit Sesame -- and I have written about both in detail at the link below.  Neither involves a trial period or requires a credit card, and what's really great is that they each pull from a different credit reporting agency, so you can get 2 (Experian and TransUnion) of your three FICO scores.

A$A$A
Annual Credit Report.com - Home Page

This is the only page that will allow you to pull a credit report for free once every 12 months. You can pull it from either Experian, TransUnion, or Equifax all at once, or do them separately (each has it’s own 12 month waiting period). I would recommend pulling one from each every 4 months, that way you really have the opportunity to check 3 times in one year.

Trust no other sites.

Q$Q$Q
What gets affected if I don't pay my Comcast or my cellphone bill?
A$A$A
1:  if you're still receiving services from the vendor, chances are that the bills are paid.

2:  if you switched services after cell phone service was cut off, chances are the bill is unpaid.

3:  providers will most certainly report non-payment to credit reporting agencies.  This results in a low credit score, which will result in being unable to get a good credit rate for a car or house loan, and can affect your ability to rent an apartment.

Q$Q$Q
Can I get this off my credit report?
A$A$A
Unfortunately, probably not, but it doesn't hurt to ask.

The "Statute of Limitation" on collections activity for Credit Reporting purposes goes off of the most recent activity on the account.  As you made the payment in 2013, it's going to show on your report until 2020.

On the plus side, closed collections accounts diminish in their impact on your credit score far sooner.  It will still be a negative mark, but the financial hit on your score will lessen over time.

You can try calling them (Credit Management) to get them to Admin Remove the collection report.  They are not *obligated* to do so (what they are reporting is factually correct, they sent you a collection letter and you paid it), but if you get lucky and catch a friendly agent on a good day, you may succeed in getting it deleted.

You *might* have better success if you contact a debt management attorney and have them initiate the "please remove this" conversation...there is a certain power in the call coming from an attorney's office...that will, of course, cost you money.  The cost/benefit of doing so is up to you.

The longest it can remain on your credit report is 7.5 years. Simply paying it off will not help your credit score. There is a tiny chance you can bargain with them to get the score removed, but in most cases they will be unable to do so. But thankfully as the score gets older it will have less of an impact on your credit score. The best thing you can do is be patient, paying it off right away was a good idea because you could technically get sued for the debt, which would most likely be worse.

Q$Q$Q
How long will it take to take the credit card score from 300 to over 700?
A$A$A
300 is the lowest theoretical FICO score. In my career, having viewed and analyzed literally thousands of credit reports, I have never seen a score that low. I have seen some in the low 500s, however. Here is what it takes to get a score that low—and I’d say it would likely take some combination of ALL of these:

Accounts that are currently past due

Accounts that are in collection

Liens, judgments, foreclosures and recent bankruptcies

Credit cards that are over-limit

Raising a very low credit score—let’s define it as one that’s below 550—is something that is certainly possible, but it will take some time. It will also take some money. I’d recommend something similar to the following:

First deal with any public record items that you can. Did someone get a small claims court judgment against you? You’ll have to deal with it. Because the judgment creditor now has a lien against you, it’s unlikely that you have a lot of negotiating clout, so you’ll likely just have to pay the full amount. It never hurts to ask, but the odds are low.

Next, deal with any collection accounts. These are somewhat different, in that most collectors (typically collection agencies and companies that have bought your debt) are willing to negotiate. Do not agree to any settlement amount without having an agreement from them in writing—and don’t agree to a “check by phone.” This will give them access to your bank account. Also, be aware that you’ll have to pay income tax on the amount they discounted the account to settle.

Once you’ve accomplished that, bring any past due accounts current. For revolving accounts (credit cards), work on getting their balance below 30% of the credit limit. That’s the point at which balances start to hurt your score. My hunch is that if your score is very low, the creditors have already closed the accounts—but they will continue to report the balances.

Finally, start establishing new credit. With a very poor credit history, it is unlikely that you’ll be able to get an unsecured card, but you can get a secured card. Credit unions issue these all the time. A $500 deposit will typically secure a $300 line of credit. Use the card often, and pay it off several times a month. Set up an automatic payment so you don’t run the risk of a late payment because of inattention. After six months or a year, they may remove the requirement for the securing account.

Many of the adverse items on your credit report will stay there for 7 years—10 years in the case of bankruptcies and foreclosures—but their effect on your score diminishes after about a year. A bankruptcy’s effects will linger for a longer time after discharge, however.

My guess is that it will take you two years or more to get your score from even 500 to over 700. I say this because even when you pay off a collection account or judgment, and bring a past-due account current, the history is still reported.

Most importantly, you have to take a hard look at the habits that got you into the spot you’re in. If you don’t change those, then you are essentially rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.

I hope this is helpful.
A$A$A
Having a score less than 400 is a clear sign of lot of negative issues on your credit report. The low score could be due to your past dues, foreclosures, settlement, exceeding the credit limit on your credit card, late payments or errors on your report.

Firstly, clear your past dues and wait for the lenders to report it to the bureaus for updating your credit report. if the low score is due to your credit card, you may have to maintain a good credit utilisation ratio and pay your bills on time. If you happen to find any errors on your credit report, raise a dispute resolution to get it cleared.

If you are unable to improve your credit score on your own, you can seek credit repair services.

A$A$A
If the score is actually 300 (which I’ve almost never seen), it means that you have some really severe negative credit items and debts, which you should work on removing, by use of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. That will likely take at least 6–7 months, more likely over a year, if your score is really in the 300’s range.

If you mean going from being new to credit (i.e. no credit score), to a 700 FICO, that is possible within about 12 to 18 months, although some lenders might say your credit history is thin or not long enough, until you’ve hit two years of credit. But, if you are added as an authorized user, open up a secured card (Discover or Capital One) and have it graduate to unsecured, and maybe add another unsecured card at the one year mark, a 700 is certainly possible within 12 to 18 months.
A$A$A
If you want it quick, pay off your balance or keep utilization under 10% before the statements come out. Moreover, never miss a payment and avoid public record (of course). To be honest, the first fico score I got (5 months after I opened my first card) was already over 700.
A$A$A
There is no way to know the time period. Think of the 3 credit repositories as black boxes where information goes in and then your credit score comes out along with comments of why you did not receive a higher score. And it is not a credit card score but your credit score. Pay your bill on time and do not have a balance exceeding 40% of your credit limit and give it a year
A$A$A
Ages maybe… just kidding… just make sure to complete all the payments on time… best way to build a credit is to make a purchase on credit card and then do the full payment in a week… 6 cycles of this kind should get you half way there….

Q$Q$Q
Which profession would you have ideally chosen for yourself if you hadn't taken money as a factor?
A$A$A
Oh, I am already doing what I love.



Read on if you want details. I took chances, made choices and found my way to do what I wanted. Brace yourself, fucked up career chart is coming up.

                                



                                    12th (PCMB student)

(I studied Hindi as an extra subject, for the "fun" of it. I scored average in rest of  the subjects but with 96% I was the top scorer in Hindi the CBSE board that year. I also received an award from the Hindi Academy of India. One of the most random things I have ever done that also paid off! ) But then my folks commented "how will this help your career?".



                         Drop a year to prepare for Pre Medical Test.

(Enroll in English Hons. from Delhi University's Open school of Learning. Indians prefer to keep a second option to fall back on. I was always interested in literature.)



                          Start volunteering for a child shelter.   

                   

              Fail to clear PMT but got through B.Pharma (close call)

Family suggests to drop another year. I said bullshit and decided to graduate in Business instead. I was ridiculed for this.



          Work at a Cafe Bar to support myself through college (I year)

              (my fave job so far, least paid too. I was paid 80 INR/hour.)



      Work in a call center for a Tech Support through summer (II year)

(Call center revolution had started in India and the Broadband revolution in UK, I used to solve tech queries, installation and modem issues for Carphone Warehouse. I made an arrangement, I did graveyard shift and cab dropped me directly to college at 10 in morning. I minted money here. Ridiculed for not studying Med.



                           Work in Market Research (II and III year)

6-8 hours of college and a 9 hour shift took a toll and I left to work at WNS GS, a firm that did Market Research for UK govt. A four hour shift made life easier. I gave final year English hons. exams too. Ridiculed for not studying Med.



                                 Intern at Reliance Industries

My  hatred for corporate job was born here. Hated every bit of being here.



                                         Graduate

I was offered a full time job at WNS as a research analyst for GlaxoSmithKline at a package much higher than what my batch-mates landed in campus placements. I didn't accept as neither I was interested in crunching numbers nor being a part of a corporate. (at this time money wasn't a motivation, interesting work was) I was ridiculed for this choice and also for not studying Med.



                  Work as a Marketing professional in TV Today Group.

At a salary half than what I was offered at GSK. I was curious about TV. It sucked. I moved on. Ridiculed for not studying Med.



                           Worked in an advertising agency

The most fulfilling, creative, back breaking and least-paying (just a little better than cafe-bar thing) work ever!



                                   Worked at Equifax.

I wanted to study more. So I planned to make decent sum of money for college by picking up a job that paid the best. I made credit reports for one of the three credit Bureaus in the US, Equifax. My report determined whether a US citizen would get credit from a bank or not (whoever said that only doctors can feel like God). For that, I had to clear nine rounds of interviews (max I have given so far) and a month long verification that also involved taking drug tests. (phew! all for the most "random" job of my life!)

                   

                                  

                                            Post graduate         

I got through London School of Communication but I am unable to get the loan as my dad refuses to be a sponsor and ridicule me a little more for not studying Med. So I settled for Advertising and Public relations at Sri Aurobindo Centre for Arts and Comm. Everything happens for the best and this was the best thing that could happen. I got to study Sociology, Photography, TV and Cinema too! I worked in WNS GS again, to support myself through PG this time.

                          Resident at Auroville, Pondicherry

Transcendental Meditation, philosophy, youth empowerment, sustainable development. I got to write for youth journals. Ridiculed for not studying Med.



         Graduate and work in a radio station for a media conglomerate.

(I had to leave the volunteer work at the shelter as I was unable to manage time) I handled marketing comm, branding, programming content and CSR for a network for 8 stations. Associate with UNICEF projects. As an extra (I volunteered) I did voice overs, edited shows, learnt to make music logs, took celeb interviews too. I was offered to do a late night English soft rock show but by that time, I had enough of radio. I left after 2 years.

                          

                    Independent UNICEF and CSR campaigns

                     

                    Currently on a Sabbatical (C'mon, I deserve one!)

During which I worked on a start up, it failed. I am working on another one. I am also, studying and thinking about what to do next.

I am still ridiculed for not studying Med.





EDIT: Quorans who have messaged me asking whether or not I lived through these years. I am an avid traveler and this was the time I have traveled the most. I also love art and theatre and I have watched my fave plays even twice or thrice as much. " I didn't miss anything."

Neha Jha's answer to For those in their mid 20s, what makes you happy?



EDIT 2: I am currently studying social work and researching on gender issues at University of Mumbai on a corporate sponsorship.

Money is necessary for a successful life but not enough...!

However I was a little bit too late at understanding this. I always excelled school in academics, but the person inside me knew that I though had talent at it but not the interest. My interest was at admiration of beauty, love and art. And as a result I started to do everything that was artistic in nature, that required creativity.

So, coming to the point, ideally if money was not even a slight factor I would have become an artist.

However, since we live on earth, where money is a prime factor for surviving in the society. So now DESIGNING is something which intersects with my passion of art and my degree in engineering. So I took a course in product design from IDC, IIT Bombay, and I was really so impressed, by everything. Now I hope to join the Institute for a masters in design after my dual degree in Engineering physics. Maybe a masters in physics could have fetched me a better job... but this will fetch fetch me a better life, since I will be loving myself.

7. Tattoo artist

8. Scuba diver

Well these are some of the professions that are on the top of my head right now and had my father had his name listed in the likes of Ambani, Birla, Kapoor than I would had become all of them.

A Professional Snooker Player!!

It might not sound much exciting to many people out there, but I have this unexplainable urge to play & learn more about Snooker as much as I can.



This guy, Ronnie O'Sullivan has achieved almost everything that a player can in this particular sport. From having the Record of achieving a maximum in just 5 minutes and 20 seconds  to winning the World Snooker Championship 2013 after staying away from the sport for almost a year.

Greatest player ever to have picked up the cue

I can totally understand how Sachin would have felt about Cricket.

As they say "Keep working hard until your IDOLS become your RIVALS"

*sigh* , Someday maybe..
A$A$A
Professional Football/soccer player.

More or less every football fanatics dream at some point.

Although I can barely kick a ball and professional football in India is pretty much non existent, the joy of playing football is unmatched for me.

Sports in general requires great mental strength and focus besides some physical abilities, developing these is a part of the whole package. I also love to motivate and coach, so I'd probably end up coaching as well after my playing days. On the long run, players keep good health and my grandmum tells me ' Health is wealth '. Although most fail to reach the very top as a player or as a coach, that would be of very little relevance when compared to the sheer joy of being involved with football.
A$A$A
This again, please.

I've loved calculators since I first touched one, and scratched my tiny head over why it always came out "1" in the end if I just pushed the square root many enough times. Nowadays, I program numerical math for parallel machinery, and my work lets me play with numbers on the most ridiculously sized calculators.

The money is all right, but frankly, I don't care that it's not spectacular, as long as I can feed my family. I am living in the middle of science fiction, and no realistic personal salary can buy it.

Wheeeee!

I would have loved to become a tour guide of this place

This place (Matheran) is a hill station in the Raigad district of Indian state of Maharashtra, and is also one of the smallest hill stations in India.

It has become a ritual for me to pay at least a yearly visit to this place ever since I was a kid. And since I've been visiting this place a lot I know everything about it.

So, I would love to become a tour guide and spend my entire life here not just for its beauty and serenity, but also because I have many  wonderful memories associated with it.

I would invest it so that it would continue to grow and support me while I blew (I mean, spent...) the rest on my version of fun:

Traveling around the world developing non-profit vocational youth training programs targeted at getting at-risk youth into solid career paths, through structured trade and workplace skills training capped with end of program job placement. I'd probably start a new one each year in a different locale and get enough solid people in place so that they can run it themselves with continued grant funding. Then I could be off to build a new one without getting bored, all while making a huge impact on generations of lives around the country and world. :)

But ask me next month and I'll probably have a different answer.

I would choose to be a writer. Travelling, interacting with strangers, observing the world, reading what I like, flexibility of working hours and even days and all this as my profession!!! That will be a wonderful life to live.

Sports coach. Or may be start a sports academy of my own to coach students.

The sports scenario in India is pretty bad. Most students are drifted apart from sports from an early age because of the parental pressure to perform well in academics. Academics is not the only way to make a career. But Indians don't understand that. So, I would really start an academy to coach such enthusiastic talented folks. Who knows may be you see more Sushil Kumars and Abhinav Bindras in the upcoming Olympics.

In fact, after earning a sufficient amount of money, I do aim to fulfill this dream.

I would have been a Tabla player.

I don’t really make people drop their jaws when I play but its something I’ve always been fascinated about. My close friends know that I love it and they cheer me up like I’m the Jakir Hussain when I’m playing Tabla but I know that’s just a sweet gesture of theirs.

So instead ! here I am, a senior analyst and a bot trying to play tabla on keyboard.

Simple! From the time I was a little boy, I wanted to be an author. Being a rich author would have been nice, but even a poor or middle class author whose name graced the cover of paperback and hardcover novels at the book store would have been marvelous. Even as a boy, I had this image of myself in front of a typewriter, wearing a corduroy jacket with leather patches on the elbows, surrounded by crumpled up paper. I wrote my first full-length book when I was 12, it was embarassingly bad and ended up in the rubbish. Eventually I tried to sell my work, but I failed at that and eventually, the lack of success and the effort required to write and manage the sales effort became greater than my ego and lifestyle could afford and I turned to other things, but it has always been my dream.

If I had the financial independence to sustain this dream, I would have adopted five orphans  and raised them. Right from their education till their marriages.

As a student who is finishing high school this year and planning to take a bachelors degree in business, it makes me worry that no one on this thread has mentioned any jobs in the business sector.

Most of all, there is always something NEW coming up, almost on a daily basis, for which I am immensely grateful.

Q$Q$Q
Will opening a new line of credit decrease my credit score? It was only a soft pull.
A$A$A
Will opening a new line of credit decrease my credit score? It was only a soft pull.

There seems to be a contradiction in your question. If you opened a new line of credit it was almost certainly a “hard pull”, not a “soft pull” as you state. Here is some detailed information about the two different kinds of credit inquiries —

“What is a hard inquiry?

A hard inquiry is an inquiry that occurs when a prospective lender checks your credit report to make a lending decision. Hard inquiries can slightly lower your credit score and will typically stay on your report for two years.

What is a soft inquiry?

A soft inquiry is an inquiry that occurs when a person or company checks your credit report as a background check, like when you check your credit score or a mortgage lender preapproves you for a loan. Soft inquiries can occur without your permission, but don’t worry – they won’t affect your credit in any way.

When do hard and soft inquiries occur?

Hard inquiries commonly take place when consumers apply for a credit card, auto loan, mortgage or other loan. On the other hand, soft inquiries typically occur when employers access your report to look for signs of risk or you check your own credit report or score from sites like Credit Karma, Credit Sesame or MyFICO. Lenders may also use soft inquiries to preapprove you for a credit card or loan. Since they’re not making a lending decision or guaranteeing approval – they're only saying you’re likely be approved for that credit card or loan – these inquiries are typically considered “promotional” and won’t affect your score.

Unfortunately, there are some gray areas where either a hard or soft inquiry could occur, including when a bank needs to verify your identity or you apply to rent an apartment or car. If you’re worried about the growing number of hard inquiries on your report, ask the financial institution or company what kind of inquiry it will make before deciding whether you’d like to proceed or not. This way, you can avoid potentially unpleasant credit surprises.

Do inquiries affect my credit score?

While soft inquiries won’t lower your score, hard inquiries could slightly lower your score. The good news: Hard inquiries typically don't affect your credit score by much – factors such as your payment history and credit utilization rate are usually weighted more heavily. However, the impact of an inquiry can vary according to your credit history. If you have few accounts, a short credit history or a ton of inquiries, an additional hard inquiry could have a greater impact on your score.

Keep in mind, when creditors see a lot of hard inquiries on a report, they become more wary about extending credit because numerous hard inquiries looks like a consumer is desperate for credit or was previously unable to get the credit he or she needed from other creditors. In other words, a lot of inquiries may make you appear like a higher-risk borrower, so it’s best to minimize them.

Can I avoid hard inquiries?

If you want to apply for a new credit card or loan, there’s no avoiding the subsequent hard inquiry.”

The Difference Between Hard and Soft Credit Inquiries

This source indicates that a hard inquiry for the purpose of extending credit (as your question indicates is your situation) will slightly lower your credit score, and will stay on the credit report for two years.

Here is a good description of how credit scores are calculated —

How Is My Credit Score Calculated? - Credit.com

Keep in mind that not all credit scores are calculated in exactly the same way. Further, some use a scale up to 850, but others use a scale up to 900.

A soft pull doesn’t affect your credit score much and even a hard pull drops it by 6 points. It only takes 3–6 months to recover. However, regular spending, paying on time, and using less than 30% of your credit limit help.

Initially it will as new accounts decrease your average age of accounts. If you got away without getting a hardpull I would not worry as your score will recoup in a few months as long as you keep being responsible.

A soft pull will not harm your credit score, only hard pulls will affect your credit.

Credit Scores: What can I do about a fraud alert placed on my social security number because of which I am unable to get loans?
A$A$A
Glad that you are anonymous because the details of your question have "fraud" written all over them: a bank will not close account because of a bounced check, you will only incur a penalty for a bounced check.

If you have attempted to defraud the bank out of thousands and did it as a trend, then and only then will they start an investigation - investigations cost money, and banks are very careful about their expenses and use of their resources.

So, you have lied about the cause for your accounts to be closed.

What's next?

You went to another bank to open a new account - which you have a right to do so. You had NOT started whether you had reimbursed your earlier bank for that bad check and fees associated with it - so we will assume that the answer is no.

The new bank ran a credit report on you and they saw a problem with your credit score and an alert for you. Did you expect that they won't find out?

They did, and they declined to accept you as a customer - they have a right to do so.

So now, you're asking how to fix this?

The only fix available is when the first bank made a report in error, thus making you a victim, and your only recourse is to show a proof that you had parted ways with your bank on amicable terms.

You don't have this proof, which means that alert won't be removed - and since it happened recently, it will remain on your credit profile for the foreseeable future.

You can't do anything at this time, and your credit score will remain as it is.

You will effectively be forced into cash-only transactions since you are locked out of banking system, and your only bet is dealing with prepaid cards (I think Walmart (company) has something for people in your situation - check with the store's associate for details).

To clarify, the alert is on your credit profile, which is linked to your SSN - for all 3 credit bureaus.

You could only remove it if it was reported in error by the bank - and you have said that this is not how things transpired.

I do not know how long fraud alerts last in the profile - I only know that bankruptcies remain active for 7 years (and as much as 10 years - but you can request it be removed after 7 years), so this is the worst case scenario.

If, however, you bounced $100 check, and bank quite blindly erupted into ruining your credit score and shutting down your accounts (all over $40 bad check fee) - meaning that you are, in fact, a victim - then you need to retain a lawyer and file a lawsuit to have your good name restored.

We're talking about millions in compensation and punitive damages here - but it's only if you are a true victim and not a fraudster.
