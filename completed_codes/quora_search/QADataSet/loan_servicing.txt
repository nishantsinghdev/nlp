Money: Are payday loans abusive? Should they be more heavily regulated?
A$A$A
Finally new Payday Loan regulations are on the way and should be unveiled today. No more 391% annual interest. Loans will need to be more reasonable—there should be an ability to pay and less rolling over. Lender should not be profiting form loans that can never be repaid and only create a vicious cycle of ever increasing debt. The number of loan will shrink under the regulations, and the industry will probably need to consolidate, but hopefully this will reduce the worst predatory cases. However some including the NY Times editorial board believe the measures does not go far enough, the measure should in include the 5% of income limit, and further similarly to the military ban on predatory lending the effective annual rate should be limited to 36% (much less than the current 391% rate).

Payday Loans’ Debt Spiral to Be Curtailed - NY Times

The payday loan industry… could soon be gutted by a set of rules that federal regulators plan to unveil on Thursday.

People who borrow money against their paychecks are generally supposed to pay it back within two weeks, with substantial fees piled on: A customer who borrows $500 would typically owe around $575, at an annual percentage rate of 391 percent. But most borrowers routinely roll the loan over into a new one, becoming less likely to ever emerge from the debt.

…lenders will be required in many cases to verify their customers’ income and to confirm that they can afford to repay the money they borrow. The number of times that people could roll over their loans into newer and pricier ones would be curtailed.

…“The very economics of the payday lending business model depend on a substantial percentage of borrowers being unable to repay the loan and borrowing again and again at high interest rates,” said Richard Cordray, the consumer agency’s director.

…According to the group’s website, “More than 19 million American households count a payday loan among their choice of short-term credit products.”

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said the median fee on a storefront payday loan was $15 for every $100 borrowed.

Both sides agree that the proposed rules would radically reshape the market. Loan volume could fall at least 55 percent, according to the consumer agency’s estimates, and the $7 billion a year that lenders collect in fees would drop significantly.

…Senator Bernie Sanders has called for a 15 percent rate cap on all consumer loans.

…Hillary Clinton praised the payday lending proposals that the consumer agency released last year and urged her fellow Democrats to fight Republican efforts to “defang and defund” the agency.

Consumer advocates are eager for new payday lending rules, but some say the bureau’s rules do not go far enough.

…Mr. Bourke said he was frustrated that the agency had dropped a proposal to require that longer-term loan payments consume no more than 5 percent of a borrower’s monthly income. The draft rules instead simply require that lenders make sure that customers can afford to repay the loans and still cover their basic living expenses and other debts.

…said George Goehl... “For decades, predatory payday lenders have gotten away with taking money from people who didn’t have much to begin with.”

…Candice Byrd, 29, is a former payday borrower who welcomes more restrictions on an industry she views as rapacious and destructive.

…[Her] loan had a six-week duration, but halfway through the period, the lender suggested that she roll it over into a new loan. “She was like, ‘You’re a good customer. This would be helpful for you,’” Ms. Byrd recalled. “It was the worst idea ever.”

…set off a worsening cycle… Unable to pay her bills, she said, she lost her car and her apartment.

…“These places want you to keep borrowing,” she said. “They don’t want you to climb out of the hole.”

A Lame Response to Predatory Loans - NY Time EDITORIAL BOARD JUNE 2, 2016

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been promising for more than a year to rein in the payday lending industry, whose business model relies on luring Americans into ruinously priced loans that can carry interest rates exceeding 400 percent. The proposal that the agency unveiled Thursday represents a down payment on that promise. But the final rule — expected next year — will need stronger, more explicit consumer protections for the new regulatory system to be effective.

The industry says it provides a convenient option for consumers, who can get a quick loan and repay it on their next payday, typically in two weeks. The bureau discredited that claim two years ago in a striking study of more than 12 million loans issued in more than two dozen states. Only 15 percent of the borrowers could raise the money necessary to repay the entire debt within 14 days without borrowing again. One in five of these borrowers defaulted at some point, which meant damaged credit and more fees. And nearly two-thirds of them renewed a loan — some more than 10 times — putting them on a path toward ruinous debt.

Most people ended up paying more in fees than the amount they borrowed. In other words, the system is expressly designed to bleed borrowers, who are typically struggling workers or people on fixed incomes who are just getting by.

…the most important of which would limit monthly payments to no more than 5 percent of the borrower’s expected gross income for the same period. This would have the effect of spreading the costs and fees over the life of the loan, instead of having them come due all at once.

The bureau dropped the 5 percent measure from its current proposal — after protests by lenders and others — but should resurrect it in the final version…

…The best solution would be for Congress to give the public the same protection from predatory lending that members of the military received under the Military Lending Act of 2007. The rules created under that law made it illegal for lenders to charge more than 36 percent for payday loans, vehicle title loans, installment loans and other forms of credit. (That rate is still quite high.)

Questions like this are easily answered when you look at the definition of the words.

Abuse:

1. To treat with cruelty or violence

2. Using something improperly, to misuse, for bad reasons.

If payday loans met either of these definitions, there might be an argument for more regulation.

Payday loans aren't violent or cruel. They are a business transaction that people enter voluntarily.

No one is being misused. The person taking out the loan is the only one in a position to judge whether they are being treated improperly. That they are making the free choice to do business and take out the loan is the indication that they do not believe they are being mistreated.

There are a couple of possible exceptions:

1. If there is deception, that's something that should be regulated, but I'm pretty sure that fraud is already illegal.

2. If the party taking out the loan doesn't have the capacity to make financial decisions for themselves. If this is the case, the regulation should be applied to the person who can't make financial decisions, not the business that is providing the service.

The payday loan business is always going to be fraught with examples of people getting themselves in trouble. This is because the type of person who would use a payday loan service tends to have existing financial problems anyway. Anywhere you collect a lot of people who are unwise with money, you are going to see a concentration of financial problem. That's not a cause to regulate the service.
A$A$A
Yes, they are.

The industry should be regulated at the federal, and not the state, level as too many abuses have slipped past overworked and occasionally corrupted state level officials.

Mother Jones magazine online has an excellent series of articles about the payday loan industry and how it abuses vulnerable consumers:

1. Payday loans are not high profit industries. They charge high interest, in part, because the loans are expensive to originate. And other operating expenses are high relative to the cost of the loan. Even non-profit payday loans charge high interest rates. One of your own sources notes this.

Payday Lending: Grounding the Policy Debate Through Economic Analysis

"It appears that high overall costs do, however, largely justify high fees."

2. Eliminating payday loans, directly or through regulatory burden, will likely lead to more illegal loan sharks.



You could have a certain cap on high-interest charging, perhaps. A person can only be charged at x interest rate for y period of time, after which they are charged at a lower set interest rate. Or if you really think the problem is that people aren't prepared to understand the transaction (I don't think ignorance is the issue, but I'm fine with the suggestion that it might be) you could have mandatory informative signs up in payday loan places about the average cost of a payday loan.

Other than that, what kind of regulation or legislation would you propose?

I'm not sure that you could reform payday loans much without making the situation worse for those who want to voluntarily use such services, and it's condescending to assume that most low-wage earners are simply incompetent.
A$A$A
The world of finance in general and borrowing particular run contra to the economic norm.

People of limited resources shop for bargains, reduced items and the less

expensive non-branded, lower quality versions. Retailers recognise and cater for this market.

The lending world takes a very different view. The less affluent are considered a greater risk. They fail standard credit assessment tests and are rejected by mainstream lenders.

So they turn to the next level of lenders who, paradoxically take the view that being low-earners and failing to  meet the demands of prime lenders means that they must pay more - higher interest rates. In practice it works like this: this body of borrowers are deemed unfit to borrow at say 3% because of their lowly financial status - instead they must expect to pay say 6%. Thus it is that those with less pay more. 

Are payday lenders abusive? They certainly take advantage of the  market. They know applicants can't borrow elsewhere. Nonetheless, they satisfy a need - a need that the authorities could do more to cover.

Regulating payday lenders has been a start. But how about expanding Credit Unions? There is this too, there are bad lenders but there are also bad borrowers.  Greater financial awareness is essential. Prudent management of personal finance, particularly budgeting is key.
A$A$A
If you believe that the government has the right to regulate products - poisoned food, unsafe car seats, amusement park rides that fly apart - why shouldn't they regulate usury? (In principle, I mean; you can certainly argue about what constitute usury - that's a different question.)

The alternatives would be to let the market decide, to let the courts decide through civil suits, or to say to hell with it and turn a blind eye to lynching purveyors of such products.  If you like the market approach, how do you handle unscrupulous vendors that change brand names and features and locations and continue selling infant formula made with strychnine?  If you like the legal approach, you'll find a lot of situations where paying out settlements is just a cost of doing business - only a few of the babies actually die from the strychnine, and most of their parents don't realize it, because who makes money warning them against such things? And they can't afford lawyers anyway.
A$A$A
Short-term lending is a legitimate business and regulation if any should be minimal. The high-interest rates that make such institutions popular targets exist because of the high default rate. Eliminating them or regulating them out of business simply takes away one possible recourse before the poorest lose their home, car,... Without this recourse, some will feel they have no choice but to turn to loan sharks that operate completely outside the law. While the potential always exists for lenders to "sell" something buyers can't afford, you can't eliminate risk without eliminating freedom. Regulation should be focused on eliminating fraud, not freedom, and to help ensure clients have the education and maturity to make informed decisions.
A$A$A
Hey there…!

Payday loans are short term loans which regardless of whether repayment of loans is linked to a borrower's payday. Best Credit SG Pte Ltd is good money lender Singapore, I recently took a payday loan from it.

Hope this helps..!
A$A$A
Saying anything is in need of regulation is an attempt to exercise political and bureaucratic power.

As an economist, you should know better than others that the interest rate is the price of risk associated with capital. Payday lenders charge high interest because of the high risk. In other words, the interest rate is high because there is a void in the market which only the payday lenders are filling up. If you are truly sympathetic to the borrowers' cause, go ahead and lend/donate your own money. But saying that payday lenders are bad while sitting on your couch (and while doing absolutely nothing to help with your money) is plain progressive intellectualism and more abusive than payday loans.

And just for the fun of it, I thought wall street loans are regulated by some of the smartest finance minds on planet earth, at least there is no dearth of heavy names like the Fed, the SEC etc. But the last time I checked those guys could never avoid big screw ups, massive crashes and bubbly boom-busts, can they?
A$A$A
It all depends on perspective. Those who benefit from payday loans, being able to receive emergency funding without extensive credit check will definitely not call such companies as abusive. The higher interest rate is to cover the risk of providing loan to credit risk individuals.

They are regulated. They are still governed by financial and lending loans which vary from state to state.
A$A$A
Those who cannot afford a specific loan should not agree to it .  Those who cannot afford a specific house should not get a mortgage on it.  Those who cannot afford a specific car should not buy it.   Those who cannot afford a specific television cable plan should not buy it.  And so on.  Those who "are not financially savvy" may make bad decisions in almost every area of economic life.   That is not an excuse to eliminate choices for everyone.

Or are you arguing that 100% of poor people are necessarily unable to make wise decisions by the mere fact that they are poor?
A$A$A
Payday loans certainly can be abusive but that doesn't mean that they need to be regulated. There are many states that try to regulate payday loans, but the companies always find loopholes. As John Oliver said on one of his episodes: "It's like playing 'whack-a-mole', you put em down and they pop right back up". Given this, I don't think it is a good solution to try to regulate these companies.

What would be a better solution is to present an alternative to disrupt the market for payday loans. Maybe people wouldn't need as much payday loans if their children could afford education and health care. Maybe they wouldn't need payday loans if companies payed them a living wage or if the welfare system was more robust.

Also, the government could just issue its own loans with lower interest rates than the payday loans (a payday loan public option if you will). This would force the payday loan companies to lower rates or close their doors.
A$A$A
People who have better terms of credit available to them do not use these sorts of loans. Therefore, they perform an important function of supplying credit to a market that would not otherwise have any available.

The alternatives basically amount to either subsidizing risk or grossly violating the lender's right to determine for himself the terms under which he risks his property, neither of which is socially desirable or sustainable.
A$A$A
Many of these payday loans are absolutely abusive and predatory. They often take advantage of low-income people with spending problems or poor money management skills. These people often do not have savings to cover unexpected costs and do not have access to other forms of credit. To my knowledge, these businesses are highly lucrative (due to the excessive interest rates without an equitable increased in risk) that payday lending business owners fight to keep them unregulated or under-regulated.

In the US, laws and regulations for payday lending vary state by state.
A$A$A
No. They are not abusive. They provide a service to borrowers who usually don't have any other options. The majority of payday loan recipients don't have a relationship with a bank or have such an abysmal credit history that no bank is willing to lend them money.

Do you know where people with bad/no credit used to get loans before the days of pay day loans? Organized crime. Do you know where those people will turn if the payday loans are regulated out of business? You guessed it. Organized crime. You can't honestly tell me that a seedy loan shark and his cousin Guido are preferable to Cash Advance America.

Several states have already experimented with banning payday loans entirely. The results were an increase in bounced checks and bankruptcies.

There's a LOT of known abuse, many lawsuits by state's attorney generals and yes there needs to be a lot more regulation.

The usury rates and heinous collection methods when one is at the point that they have to grit their teeth to sign up for one of these is simply too much.

Cannot believe that there is any doubt about this or that anyone can defend this practice.
A$A$A
If it were more highly regulated or banned altogether, underground (illegal) alternatives would pop up.  These alternatives would be more costly to consumers because lenders would have to cover the high cost of evading the law.  These higher costs could be recouped financially, or by cutting corners through breaking the law in yet more areas, such as using violence or to enforce loan terms, or simply changing the terms at the discretion of the lender under threat of violence.

How much does loan servicing cost for real estate seller financing?
A$A$A
Many of the title companies have servicing departments. Look for smaller servicers that cater to private money lenders. We had been using GrandCanyon Title Servicing for many years, but, they were recently sold to LoanCare. Stay away from LoanCare. There’s a newer company called Evergreen Note Servicing (Evergreen Note Servicing | Note Servicing Made Simple) in Phoenix that has most of the employees that fled GrandCanyon when LoanCare took over. Depending on the services provided servicers, in general, charge around $30/month. If it’s a larger, more complex transaction you could go with Cohen Financial (https://cohenfinancial.com/loan-...).
A$A$A
Call around to some banks or institutions that will set up these accounts and get some prices.

In my experience, not all banks will do it. Ask title companies who they use for these situations or other investors.

The one I set up is a couple of hundred a year, but is with a smaller, local bank, and a larger regional institution gave me a lower number but I liked the local choice.

I can't really say the exact amount you will pay, but I will say it was worth it for me to set up the owner financed escrow account. Why? They professionally track all payments, interest, principal, etc. The buyer pays the bank (not me, the seller) so it gives added credibility in my view. The money then goes to my account at the same bank. Easy.

We get statements for tax purposes (them for Interest paid, me for interest income received). It puts the process on autopilot and gives you highly accurate and credible statements and records. In a transaction as large as a property purchase, you can add value through the use of a financial intermediary like a bank or financial institution to service the loan. It takes the guesswork out of accounting and paperwork and prevents problems in my view.

Best of luck.
E$E$E

Q$Q$Q
When should you call your loan servicer?
A$A$A
Call them as soon as you know you are going to be late with a payment. Be ready to discuss if this is just a one time problem, or long term; what you want to do with the property, (keep it or sell it); what you are doing to solve your problem; and finally, what it is you would like them to do for you.

Once you know what you want them to do for you, start researching it. For example, are your going to request a loan modification? If so, do research on the lender. See what kind of loan mod programs thay have. See what other borrowers are saying on line about the lender. Find out what criteria that lender uses to decide on granting a loan mod, and find out what information they will need from you.
A$A$A
If all else fails you can sell to an investor like us. We buy houses Everywhere!

  Sell your house in any condition even if you owe more than the house is worth - investorwize.com
A$A$A
Certainly you should keep in touch with your loan servicer. If you are in need of real assistance you might also want to call a housing counselor. Go to the HUD web site and search under housing counseling agencies to find one in your area.

A good counselor can advise you on avoiding foreclosure and tell you about the various government sponsored plans that are available for distressed home owners.

Very good question and thank you for asking. I am sure you will find your answer below along with additional helpful information.

Besides leaving your home country to come study in the United States, oftentimes the most difficult part about studying abroad for international students is securing the funding, or finding an education loan, in order to study in the United States. Higher education in the United States can be expensive, and more so for international students.

International students are not able to receive education loans from the United States government. However, that does not mean there are no options for international students to receive loans. Thankfully, there are a number of options available.

One way to receive funding for your education is through financial aid packages from your university. Each university differs in the packages they have available and the requirements to be eligible for a package, so it is suggested that you contact your university in order to find out more information about the financial aid that they offer. US News offers a list of the top ten universities that award the most financial aid to international students. These universities include the University of Chicago, Harvard, and Yale. If a school does not offer a financial aid package, some schools offer loans.

If you do not qualify for financial aid or your school does not offer loans, there are still other options available to international students. Mention scholarships and link back to old scholarship blog. There are companies out there who give education loans to international students if they have a cosigner who is a permanent United States resident (green card holder or U.S. citizen), which can be difficult for an international student to find.

Still, even without a cosigner, there are other lending options for international students to secure funding for the studies in the United States. Undergraduate juniors and seniors, and graduate students attending a variety of schools in the U.S. may have this option. There are a number of variables that determine if an international student is able to get a loan. Nomad Credit can help you find these lenders.

There are also options available to secure lending in your home country with a cosigner from your home country. For example, if you are an Indian and wish to come to the United States to study from India, you can receive a loan from an Indian institution. This could potentially be a better option because you may not require a cosigner. These are available from different banks and credit unions, and some may even have study abroad plans that cover not only tuition but other expenses as well.

In order to secure funding for your studies in the United States, there are a few tips we have to help you in your search for loans. One, as mentioned earlier, do your research, start it early, and take your time with it. Even if you have not been admitted into the program or school you wish to be admitted to, you should still start researching your options so you are not scrambling last minute. Also, if you feel like you cannot secure the proper funding, it allows you to look into other education options as well. We also suggest asking many questions. There are a lot of variables and terms that come with loans, so the more you know, the less you will be surprised in the future. Finally, if you have been admitted and have not looked into loan options yet, get on it right away; do not wait a long time to apply for a loan. This will help speed up your visa application process to prove you can fund your studies in the United States.

We understand that finding the right loans to fund your study in the United States can be difficult. At Nomad Credit, we strive to help international students find funding for their studies. For more information, visit nomadcredit.com. We will happily help you find the best option for education loans or study loans as well. If you have any questions, send an email to help@nomadcredit.com and we will happily help!

For the best terms and the lowest rate, you will need a US co-signer. This can include a US citizen or permanent resident [green card holder]. Co-signing is a little different than vouching in that the person will be guaranteeing that you will pay your student loans off. If you don’t, then they are liable for that debt.

Lenders base underwriting decisions on credit history, and an international student has none. If you’re able to use a US co-signer, you have an array of options to choose from. Make sure to shop around and to check multiple financial institutions, including credit unions. Terms and conditions for such loans are constantly changing and can be unique to your specific circumstances, that it is better that you ask around yourself.

If you don’t have access to a US co-signer, you may qualify for an unsecured personal loan through the company I work for. Stilt is a marketplace lender to high-skilled immigrant borrowers. If you qualify, our loans will not require a co-signer or collateral, and we lend up to $25,000.

If you’re looking to attend certain post-graduate programs as an international student, Prodigy Finance can finance your loans often without a co-signer or collateral. However, they only accept certain programs in business, law, engineering and public policy. Visit their website to see if your program qualifies: Investing in International Business School Students

Another option is to examine options in the country you are coming from. In India, for example, student loans are possible but will be need to be collateralized. Collateralizing such debt often comes with a parent or other family member having to take out a second mortgage. It’s a big request.

About Stilt:

Stilt provides loans to international students and working professionals in the U.S. (F-1, OPT, H-1B, O-1, L-1, TN visa holders) at rates lower than any other lender. Learn more about us on wikipedia or visit us at https://www.stilt.co. If you have any questions, send us an email at team@stilt.co.

CitiAssist has shut down its student loan department. AFAIK, Sallie Mae and Citizen bank are the options right now (when you have a co-signer who is a green card holder or US Citizen).

They borrow money from someone else. They, then, loan some of that money to you. They charge you interest and fees.

The difference between the rate of interest they charge you, and the amount of interest they owe to the original lender, is their gross operating income. Add in the fee income, and subtract out the other costs of running the business. And, there is your bottom line.
