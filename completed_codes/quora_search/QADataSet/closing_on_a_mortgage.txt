On a mortgage refinance, how do I evaluate when it makes sense to pay higher interest but have lower closing costs?
A$A$A
Your mortgage calculator has it right. I'd take option 1 with the lower rate over the lower closing costs.

I've seen so many of these refi scenarios where the bank complicates the decision like this. You've done a great job at boiling it down to the bottom line. The tradeoff is always money upfront vs. interest rate, and I'd always to with the lower rate.

The underlying assumption here is that the refi makes sense for you. You can do a quick evaluation to determine this. Divide the difference in monthly payment into the total cost of the refi. That will result in the number of months you'll have to stay in the house for the refi to break even.
A$A$A
Ask them for one more option. Option 3: Instead of receiving a a refund/rebate, you pay $2,411 in cash,  upon closing, for an even lower interest rate (i.e. 3%, or 3.125%).

Q$Q$Q
Why would a mortgage company wait until a week before the closing date to send everything in to the initial underwriter?
A$A$A
In the past, I would have agreed with the other comments.  However, things are changing since the Dodd-Frank Act passed a few years ago.

Many of the 'big banks' are going through a double underwriting process.  It's supposed to be a 'checks and balances' system.  So, two sets of underwriting doesn't surprise me.

I have no idea about your market conditions so I'll have to share based on my market conditions.  Things are busy.  Lenders, surveyors, REALTORS, title companies and everyone associated with the process is backed up.  It's likely that the appraisal was ordered on time but took a while to get. I'm seeing that regularly here.  The loan originator often is required to have the complete file before they can submit it to underwriting. A complete file means the appraisal is in.

I suggest you ask your lender what slowed down the submission.  They may have a legitimate answer and they may not.

Hopefully, you hired someone you felt comfortable with and trusted.  Asking them shouldn't be a big issue.  Frankly, I would have more faith in my loan officer than strangers on a social network site who know nothing about my financial/loan package.
A$A$A
This doesn't sound right to me. There should be one underwriting process for a loan, not two.

You should have had a clear understanding from the lender as to the process and the time it will take, which all should have been disclosed in documents or loan agreements already signed with your lender. Review these documents carefully.

As for the effect on your pending closing, those terms and conditions will be contained in your sales contract, which may or may not provide for extension of the closing date due to a delay in financing. If it does not then you would seek an extension of that date with the seller.

Good luck!
A$A$A
It's no surprise that the lender is the slowest in the transaction. So you're saying you haven't settled on a loan amount yet? A lot of the times a loan amount and number is "finalized" not too long after the contract is executed. All the legal work related to the transaction can be completed in a week. Unfortunately, your lender is slowing the process and there isn't much you can do about it.
A$A$A
Okay so here is my best guess because we're missing facts.  First, check to see where your loan originator works. Does he/she work for a depository bank, non-bank mortgage lender OR does he/she work for a mortgage broker? Go here and search by name or the LO's individual license number:

Consumer Access

If your LO works for a mortgage broker it is important to understand that a broker does not make loans. He/she represents consumers and helps consumers find the mortgage money needed to complete the transaction. They are a "middleman" and that means the broker does not make the decision on whether or not to make the loan.  If you are working with an LO who works under a mortgage broker, then likely this is the issue: The loan was not actually submitted to the entity (bank or lender) that will be funding the loan until now. 

If your LO works for a depository bank or non-bank lender, then what could have happened is that the LO sends your credit profile through an automated underwriting system.  The system spits out an answer that might look something like this:

1) Approved! Go get the following documents and let a human underwriter see the documents.

or

2) This is a complex scenario.  Have a human underwriter look at the entire credit package

3) Denied.

Perhaps what happened is scenario 1. You're waiting for a human to take a look at whatever documentation was needed. 

James Spray also had another suggestion: If you are obtaining a conventional loan that requires private mortgage insurance (because you have less than 20% equity) then the private mortgage insurance company also has the duty to completely underwrite the entire file after they lender says "approved." 

I highly encourage you to talk directly with your licensed loan originator or his/her supervisor and ask for a careful explanation with an estimated timeline.
A$A$A
If there are two underwriters, the best I can guess is that you are getting two loans or that mortgage insurance is required. If this is not the case, you may wish to talk with a supervisor in your loan originator's office to gain a better understanding of their internal loan origination process. If your mortgage application is for a purchase as opposed to a refinance transaction, you may also wish to have your real estate agent contact the lender to see if anything can be done to expedite the process.

Apparently they (Loan Depot) had different accounting principal [ Illinois vs Fla]

One used my 3 year average income during which my wife and I both received huge retirement checks almost sufficient to pay for the house [$350k]. The Illinois Loan Depot underwriter only want to use my w-2 and other SS checks and small personal business. I own a condo [paid for ] in Boca Raton, Fl and a summer home in NC [50% finance thru Bank of America]. Our credit score 800. They claim that my D/I was of ????

Q$Q$Q
Why don't (most) people close a mortgage without an advisor?
A$A$A
Because for most people it is the single largest financial transaction they are going to be a part of, there are copious amounts of forms and legal procedures to follow, messing up any of which can cause massive legal issues down the road.

The Couple of thousand dollars in Closing Costs to hire a professional to navigate the waters is a tiny, tiny price to pay for the assurance that it will be done right (or that if it isn’t done right, there is someone who you can pursue for damages to rectify the error)

Q$Q$Q
How can you avoid paying the closing costs of a mortgage upfront, aside from having the seller pay?
A$A$A
If your loan is large enough you can build the closing costs into the rate. You will pay a higher interest rate but cover your closing costs.

It usually makes more sense to put less money down and/or have the closing costs built into the price (seller concession).

You are paying either way but your payment would be lower by getting the better rate.
A$A$A
Some lenders will give you a loan at no points and no closing cost [to them], but you will also have a higher interest rate to off set these costs.
A$A$A
In most cases, the lender can bump up the rate and give the borrower a rebate to cover closing costs instead of charging for the loan. For example on an FHA loan I am able to get a client with average credit a loan at about 3.875%paying the regular closing costs (one point loan origination fee). If I charge 4.5%and the loan amount is high enough I can get a rebate that will cover the buyers closing costs.
A$A$A
As long as appraised value will be sufficient, you raise the sales price up to the amount of the closing costs and then get the seller to agree to pay the costs for you
A$A$A
Generally all closing costs are paid at closing…most mortgage cos. Have no problem with this. The odd co., might want an application fee beforemsettlement. Having the sellermpay them won't happen till settlement any way. Why would the seller pay any of your cost prior to settlement!

Q$Q$Q
Should I wait until after getting a mortgage before closing a credit card and opening another?
A$A$A
At that high level (770), its not likely that a single inquiry (that will most likely result in an approved credit card with a zero or low balance) will significant reduce your score and/or negatively impact your ability to get a mortgage. However, unless there's some urgency to get the new credit card, your instincts are right on target - why take any risk? Just put off applying for the new card until after your mortgage has closed (e.g. been approved and funded). That shouldn't take more than a few weeks and, unless you were planning on conducting a lot of one-time (e.g. never-to-be-repeated) transactions with that new credit card, the rewards you'd have earned in the near term can just be earned later.

PS: Congratulations on doing a stellar job of keeping your finances in good order. That 770 score is an achievement you should be proud of.
A$A$A
If you're in the midst of getting a mortgage, whether it's for an investment property or a primary residence, then don't make any significant financial changes unless you absolutely have to. 

A new credit card will likely have minimal incremental impact as you've likely had your credit history pulled for the mortgage application within the past 30 days.  Still, if you're looking only at getting some rewards, then you should hold off, even if you're at no danger of being denied a loan.  Having to explain the new credit line to a lender is a pain not worth any credit card intro reward.
A$A$A
Kevin W Hardin stated the facts quite well. I will only add that closing a well seasoned card is likely not in your best interest from the standpoint of your credit profile. The more aged that credit line is translates to the better for your credit score. The opposite can also be true as the line has not aged. By aging, think years not months.
A$A$A
Your mortgage loan officer should have already informed you to NOT make any change to your credit profile until your mortgage is funded. It is one of the critical DO NOTS in lending. Apply for the mortgage and go into a holding pattern on all other financial agreements. Make all payments on time and don't incur any new debt or inquiries until done.
E$E$E

Q$Q$Q
Can a mortgage lender request additional information on source of gift funds after closing?
A$A$A
They may ask for anything but I don’t believe you’re obliged to provide it.

Another answer mentioned the form agreeing to correct any mistakes, but that refers to administrative corrections, like providing a missing signature.

If your gift funds were legitimate, it would be helpful to provide the info — the lender may need it to complete their file, sell the loan, insure the loan, etc. Also, if they suspect fraud and your gift is legit, providing the info may avoid further investigation. Loan fraud is investigated by the FBI and why get the wheels turning, if there’s no reason to?

Also, we often bypass the sourcing of gift funds by wiring the gift directly to escrow (instead of sending a check to escrow). As long as the source account matches the account info stated on the giftor’s gift letter, no further documentation is needed.

You could probably ignore the request. If you speak with them, you might tell them you are very “busy” and, as far as you are concerned, “the loan is done and you don’t want to deal with it anymore.” They probably won’t investigate any further unless you get behind on the payments.
A$A$A
There's a form you signed…I believe it's called the x or z form but I could be wrong about the name…any way…it's what I call the banks cover their ass form and essentially it says any mistakes made on the application or in the mortgage you agree to the correct intent of the mortgage. This might fall under that. There's also the buyers affidavit which states everything you've told the bank was true and that none of the funds used as downpayment, or for closing costs were borrowed.
A$A$A
There is a mortgage form you signed likely called either Compliance and/or called Errors and Omissions and often will include a clause which states you agree to comply and cooperate by providing any additional documentation post closing up to 90 - 120 days. Usually this for the lender to sell your loan. No matter what you are required to comply or be ready for legal action against you.
E$E$E

Q$Q$Q
How can one get financed with a mortgage loan even when using a closing cost grant program?
A$A$A
Closing Cost Assistance/Grant programs, and Down Payment Assistance/Grant programs, are used with a mortgage — they go hand-in-hand — and may even make it easier for you to qualify for the mortgage.

When you apply for a mortgage, tell the lender that you will (or would like to) use a closing cost/down payment assistance program. This information will be added to your loan file so that the underwriter understands how you will pay the closing costs and/or down payment.

Note that CCA/DPA programs are available from employers, lenders, government/city agencies, and even the Realtor association (in California), so hunt around for opportunities. The programs have guidelines you must meet in order to qualify and these rules vary by program. Be sure to work with a lender who is familiar with them — many are not.
A$A$A
Qualifying for the loan is strictly a matter of income, current debt, length of time in current job, or if current job is less than two years, current industry, credit history etc. The bank will verify that you have funds on hand to pay the down payment and closing costs. If those funds show up in your bank account suddenly, you will be asked to explain where they came from. This is to make sure you did not borrow the money for the down payment from another source throwing your debt to income ration out of balance. This is why realtors and lenders tell people that if the funds to buy the house are a gift from a relative to have them deposit the money in your account a few months ahead of time. If you are receiving a grant to assist with closing costs merely provide your lender with a copy of the letter. The lender will add this to your file.

Q$Q$Q
How does a mortgage loan officer solve the problem of gathering all the correct conditions only once and consistently closing before the lock ends?
A$A$A
Okay hold on while I laugh uncontrollably for 5 seconds.  If life were this easy, the world would not need loan originators.  I'm going to lay this out so everyone can get a visual on why it is so difficult to know, at the time of the loan application, what might be required.

A mortgage loan itself is like a machine with many moving parts.

The mortgage industry is like a machine with many moving parts.

A mortgage company is also like a machine with many moving parts.

Loan originators work under the production side of a mortgage company.

The person who makes the decision on whether or not the loan is approved or declined, and if approved, what further documentation is needed is called a mortgage loan underwriter.  Think of an underwriter as "quality control."

Here's another way to understand the problem. Since the majority of mortgage LOs are compensated for their production via commission, then if LOs were in charge of the decision, EVERY loan would be approved every time with no conditions.

But alas, the real world is not so simple and when a mortgage company is structured to allow LOs to make decisions, or for LOs to have some sort of "control" over the underwriter, many bad loans get approved, many go into foreclosure, and a certain percentage of these people end up in jail.  Don't believe me? Google "Shawn Portmann" "mortgage fraud" and look for the article written by a Seattle publication called The Seattle Weekly for a glimpse into the dark abyss on how things like this happen. 

Quality Control (underwriting) MUST BE separate from Production (loan origination and loan processing.)

So that still doesn't answer your questions and now it's time for me to give you my answer:

IF YOU ARE A CONSUMER

1) If you are a consumer reading this, select a VERY experienced loan originator who works full time.  Someone who has worked in the industry for 10 years but only has done 1 loan a year is someone I would avoid.  You are looking for a career veteran who has originated many loans over the course of a 20+ career.  The more loans the LO has seen, the more situations the LO has lived through and this person can arguably work in a more efficient manner.

2) We can counter that by saying that a brand new LO might work harder for you if he/she is recently licensed because this person is fighting to create new business.  But this person needs to be paired with a competent loan processor.  If you're considering working with a brand new LO explain your concerns to him/her and see what he/she says. In a way, you are letting a new person "practice" on you.  You're looking to hear that there is a supervisor nearby, onsite, mentoring the new LO.



IF YOU ARE A MORTGAGE industry person reading this looking for the answer:

You are working for a company that is not training you. Once licensed, an LO needs to be paired with a competent loan processor who will hold your hand and train you for the first 25 years of your career so that you are asking for as much documentation as possible up front, before the loan goes to see a human underwriter.

Brand new LOs can be given a license and software but that doesn't teach you how to analyze the documentation the consumer gives you.  This takes a human brain. Your branch manager or loan processor can teach you these things, one file at a time. 

Brand new LOs: Your company should be able to provide you with a checklist of common required documentation that is provided to all applicants. You're asking the borrower to bring all this information in to the appointment if you're meeting face to face, OR have the information sent to you in advance of the appointment, even if it's just a couple of hours via email or fax, so you can have a chance to analyze the documents before the appointment and even have your processor or branch manager look everything over before the appointment so that another list of documentation can be prepared for your borrower to be working on after the appointment is over.

If the goal is to close on time, then consider reverse engineering the entire timeline from that date, working backwards in time so that you know how many days you will need to do each task.  It is possible that there is software out there that will do this for you. Since you're asking this question, then I'm assuming you don't have the software so then work with the other human brains in your office to help you create a project management-type timeline. Every day, you're doing something different to make sure your client's loans close on time.  

This is how you earn your commission:  CLOSING THE LOAN ON TIME.

This is not how you earn your commission: TAKING AN INCOMPLETE LOAN APP.

We had a name for what it was like to take a loan app and then never ask the borrower for any more documentation. We called that the real estate bubble of the 2000s and it ended in a massive, 7 year recession with hundreds of thousands of foreclosures.  So hopefully we will not ever go back to what some called a euphoria for LOs.  Those days are hopefully gone forever.

This is a fun industry, a great way to make a living if you like to work hard and you're highly ethical.  Go show this answer to your loan processor and ask him/her if he/she likes training new people. You want to be paired with a processor who loves training new people.  Because this person is the key to your answer.

A highly competent loan processor will have the entire loan file pre-underwritten before any human underwriter sees any of the conditions.  This is the secret to a happy life, happy customers, and loans that close on time.

Best of luck to you in this industry! I love it.
A$A$A
In the beginning, take a complete loan application, detail every facet of the information provided on the loan application. Strive to submit condition free files.

It helps immensely to have and use a complete checklist and understand how to go about documenting each section of the loan application.

Don’t dally, don’t wait for timelines to become challenging, be aggressive, make sure you can meet the deadlines before you make promises.

Secure a complete checklist of required documents for each type of loan you endeavor to have approved. Ask your manager for help in making sure you have accurate check lists for each type of loan you are endeavoring to have approved.

Hopefully your manager knows what is needed. If not, find a firm that will really train you rather than throw whatever to the wall to see if it sticks. Some firms will actually train you.

You may wish to continue looking to find a firm which will help you succeed.

Q$Q$Q
With 7 days to close on my mortgage loan I get a call from lender that my score dropped due to a recent medical collection.  How do I fix this?
A$A$A
I assume this means your score dropped enough that it is causing you a qualifying problem or a higher rate.

Luckily, there is a process called a rapid re-score that your lender’s credit reporting company can do. If you can provide proof from the creditor that the account was reported in error, or that they wish for it to be removed, you can pay about $30 to each credit bureau and they can get the credit scores updated in as little as a couple days.

First, I’d contact the doctor’s office or hospital and complain. Collection agencies don’t care, so don’t call them first. Medical practices, however, often do. Beg, cry, scream… whatever you have to do to get them to help. Let them know the stakes… your are not getting your home because of their bill. If you owe it, tell them you’ll pay them ONLY if they have the collection agency REMOVE the entire account.

CAUTION… the collection agency will want to show it paid with a zero balance. This will NOT raise your score. The only way is to have the account deleted completely.

Because it is new, you have a shot.

Second, you can try the collection agency. Same thing… let them know you didn’t know about the account, and that your doctor should have billed your insurance. Try to convince them that you will pay if they delete the account. Again, not marking it paid in full.

Third, if neither of these work, have your lender run a credit score simulator with the credit company. They likely have this service available. They can input the minimum needed credit score to make your deal work, and it will suggest options such as paying down an account balance on a credit card, etc. It may tell you how to get your score back high enough to work. Make those recommended changes, and pay to have your credit rescored.

Ask if you can talk directly with the credit company… these are not the 3 bureaus, but companies that service the mortgage industry and provide these reports to them. They generally have credit experts that will be able to look at your credit reports and offer some guidance.

If you need to pay off some balances to raise the score, you may need to put less down payment, or take a loan from your 401(k) or get a gift from a relative to free up some cash.

Lastly, if all else fails, ask your lender how to restructure. You may have to take a worse rate or program to make it work. It may hurt a little, but it may get you your home.

Unfortunately, even a small balance collection account can drop your score dramatically, and you have little power to do anything about it once it’s on there. The good news is that new medical accounts may be easier to beg with the creditor on.

Good luck, I hope you have a savvy loan officer and maybe a friendly doctor’s office that can help you get through this to get your home.
A$A$A
Thanks for the A2A, but Karyn Weger has given a superb answer that already says it all. I would have written something along the same lines.
A$A$A
Unless you can get a quick re-score like Karyn Weger refers to you don’t have enough time to be able to increase your credit score and close on the loan. It sounds to me like you’re screwed. You may be able to do a lot of the things the commenters have suggested but, in the meantime, the seller of the house you want is going to want to sell his house to someone who can buy it.

I’ve run into this from both the buyer and seller side. Once, there was an issue that maybe, perhaps could have been resolved in a “month or two”. The seller didn’t want to deal with waiting and the uncertainty so the deal fell through and the buyer had to look for another house when they got their issue resolved.

It’s tough when something happens that is beyond your control like a medical issue. Unfortunately, buying a home is a financial transaction. The mortgage company doesn’t care about your personal issues. Neither does the seller. It’s about the money.
A$A$A
This is unfortunately common. You can pay it and see if the creditor will remove it(which they generally won’t) or change lenders to do one that will accept the lower score.

There are lenders that will go as low as 580 credit score right now. You’ll need to pay the collection off though regardless.

Good luck!
